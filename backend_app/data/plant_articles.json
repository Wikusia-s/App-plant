    "content": "Why Your Peace Lily Won’t Bloom & Tips To Make It Flower Many houseplant parents ask us how to make a peace lily bloom. The peace lily is a very common houseplant that’s only outdoor-hardy in USDA zones 10-11, but the plant thrives in low-light situations, making it perfect for indoor office decor. While the glossy, green leaves are attractive, most gardeners buy the plant for its inflorescence. The cupped, creamy white, spathe enfolds the spadix and enhances the greenery. But once the bloom is finished, can you make it bloom again? Peace lily flowering takes quite a bit of patience, and the right conditions. Peace Lily Flowering Stages In a commercial setting, peace lilies are grown in carefully controlled environments. This is to ensure that the plants are flowering by the time they’re displayed for purchase. This member of the Arum family doesn’t produce an actual flower but instead a flower-like modified leaf, the spathe. A blooming peace lily is beautiful and getting the plant to produce the spathe again is a gardener’s challenge. The spathe is long-lasting but will eventually turn green and then brown when it is done. During its life cycle, the plant buds, blooms, sets seed, then the flower wilts. When Does a Peace Lily Bloom? Purchased peace lilies have been forced to bloom. Professional growers treat the plant with gibberellic acid. Known as GA in the trade, this substance is a plant hormone that drives blooming, among other things. It is a natural product derived from the Gibberella fujikuroi fungus that occurs on rice plants. After spraying the plant with GA, the flower will be produced around 70 days later. The plants generally bloom in mid-spring, around April, with the flower lasting over a month. How Often Does a Peace Lily Bloom? Peace lilies produce blooms once the growing season begins and may occasionally produce a flower in early fall. Getting 2 annual blooms requires exacting conditions that mimic those of their native range in the tropical forests of Columbia and Venezuela. The plant must have the perfect light, proper temperatures and humidity to form even 1 flower. Why Is My Peace Lily Not Flowering? A peace lily not flowering is a very common occurrence; the internet is flooded with searches about the peace lily not blooming. Once the spathe fades and it is cut away from the plant, the peace lily is often kept just as a foliage plant, never to bloom again. Indoor home conditions are rarely optimal for generating another bloom, but structured changes to the environment or growing the plant in a controlled area can force it to flower. Not Enough Light Peace lilies (Spathyphyllum) are understory plants that receive filtered light through the tree canopy. They like low light but too little light will prevent the plant from blooming. Most of the time it thrives in light as low as 20 candles, but when you want it to bloom, this amount must be increased. The plant will respond to the short day-long-night photoperiod of fall and winter by forming a bud. But, except a few cultivars, these plants will not form buds during the long-day-short night part of the year. Wrong Time of Year This photoperiodism response is typical of many plants. Light changes are sensed by photoreceptors that in turn cause hormonal changes. Auxins are plant hormones that drive new growth. They are what informs the plant that it is time to bloom. Peace lily is a short-day response plant. So plants will begin to form buds in the cooler season and fully flower when the days become longer. Plant Isn’t Old Enough A peace lily must be several years old before it will flower. While studies have shown younger plants produce more flowers, very old plants may simply stop producing blooms. Young plants will generally produce a bloom in about 15 months in perfect conditions. How to Make a Peace Lily Bloom Peace lily plants respond not only to light changes, but to temperature and humidity levels. To encourage the plant to bloom, move it to a slightly brighter location. Plants that undergo a chilling period of 54 degrees Fahrenheit (12 C) for a few weeks will flower earlier than those in warmer temperatures. The optimal average temperature year round is 72 F (22 C). The plants also enjoy significant humidity. In homes with central heating, they often do not receive enough ambient moisture. Mist the leaves daily or place the container on a saucer filled with pebbles and water. This will evaporate and increase the humidity around the plant. The plant does not need much fertilizer but the chance of a bloom increases with an application of balanced fertilizer every 6 to 8 weeks during the growing season. Removing spent flowers will encourage plants to rebloom. Avoid placing the plant near drafts and allow it to become pot bound. With a little luck, the plant will bloom again."

    "content": "As far as plants that are given as gifts go, the peace lily is by far the most popular houseplant to be gifted in the UK. This is great, because peace lilies are amazing gifts and even more amazing as plants. But peace lilies are not always easy to look after, meaning that many peace lilies sadly perish each year - often needlessly. Don't worry though, this guide will ensure that a peace lily will never again suffer at the hands of a human again - with our complete guide to keeping your peace lily healthy. Why Peace Lilies Make Lovely Houseplants To begin with, here are some fun facts about the peace lily, starting with the fact it has a really silly sounding Latin name - spathiphyllum wallisii. Aside from their silly Latin name, they have some other interesting characteristics. They are native to a tropical climate and grow in the wild in central America and northern South America. This means that they are well suited to growing in our warm and cosy homes because this is somewhat similar to their native environment. Something that is unusual for a plant that grows in rainforests is that the peace lily doesn't need too much water to survive (more on this further down). Peace lilies aren't just peaceful by name, they also are among the super plants that NASA identified in their clean air study. This study was essentially to determine which plants would be best to grow in space for the purposes of cleaning air. Peace lilies were found to reduce the amount of formaldehyde and benzene in the air, both chemicals that are found in household products. The peace lily is also NOT a lily. Lilies are toxic to pets like cats and dogs, but the peace lily isn't nearly as toxic to our furry friends. It really does come in peace, mostly, as it will probably cause discomfort if ingested by humans or animals. The Right Conditions for Your Peace Lily Peace lilies are relatively easy to grow at home and the key to their care is less is more. Oftentimes well meaning giftees will put their peace lily on the windowsill in direct sunlight, which isn't terrible, but it isn't beneficial. Peace lilies grow in partial shade conditions and even do well in low light conditions. Watering Requirements Peace lilies need watering, but not nearly as much as you might expect. Normally it is best to water your peace lily every few days with the plant even being tolerant to being watered less often if it is kept somewhere humid in the house like the bathroom. In dry summer conditions or if the room is well ventilated, the plant should be watered every two days at a minimum. The key here is to know how much water is available to the plant from the environment and bathroomlilies often get overwatered. If you notice your peace lily looks in ill health it is likely as a result of watering, so re-adjust your watering to rectify the problem. Pruning Peace Lilies Another reason that peace lilies die is because people prune them to cut them back or to try and encourage new growth. Peace lilies don't need pruning, if a part of the plant dies it will fall off and the plant will concentrate on repairing itself. When pruned, this will be too much work for the peace lily to cope with and it often will outright kill your plant. Peace Lily Flowering Peace lilies will flower in the spring and will stay in bloom until the middle of summer. Peace lilies are evergreen plants so they will always provide colour and won't drop their leaves. If you notice your peace lily has dropped a leaf or two, it is likely because they had died or become inefficient, and the plant will be growing new leaves. Position in the Home The best place to keep a peace lily is either in the bathroom or in a room that is frequented by people such as a living room. This is because peace lilies love humidity and both people and bathroom equipment cause lots of humidity. It is best not to leave peace lilies by external doors or windows because the plants don't do well in exposed conditions. Peace Lily Troubleshooting If you have followed the abovementioned tips, you should be able to avoid any peace lily heartbreaks. But if you do find your plant in poor health or if you're wondering what peace lily poor health looks like, then this list breaks down what to look for. Peace Lily Wilting Remember earlier we mentioned overwatering? Well, this is what is likely to be causing your wilting. The roots become overwhelmed by the amount of water and rot, which in turn causes the lily to wilt. The only way to stop death is to stop watering and hope the lily recovers, but wilting could be too far and the plant could be unsavable. Leaf Drying/Discoloration This is normally caused by being burnt by direct sunlight or the conditions in the home being too dry. Move the peace lily to a shaded part of the bathroom and it should get better. Pests Lastly, houseplants are prone to bugs and mites that take up residence on the lily's leaves. A quick check can diagnose if this is an issue. If you find mites or bugs, then wipe your leaves down thoroughly and then check the plant every few days. Pests are likely to have been carried in by other houseplants, so if you get rid of them, they shouldn't come back. And that's it, all you need to know to keep your peace lily healthy, and most of it is just not to try as hard. Simple."

    "content": "Peace lilies are hugely popular houseplants that are super easy to grow. They feature glossy, emerald-green leaves that grow in very low light. In fact, the peace lily plant's ability to grow in offices and light-deprived homes has earned it the nickname “the closet plant.” However, when placed in bright, indirect light, peace lilies can produce elegant white flowers (a.k.a. spathes) almost year-round. This guide covers everything you need to know to grow and care for this tropical plant successfully. Peace Lily Overview Genus Name Spathiphyllum Common Name Peace Lily Additional Common Names Spathe Lily, White Sails Plant Type Houseplant Light Part Sun, Shade Height 1 to 3 feet Width 1 to 6 feet Flower Color Green, White Foliage Color Blue/Green Season Features Fall Bloom, Reblooming, Spring Bloom, Summer Bloom, Winter Bloom Special Features Good for Containers, Low Maintenance Propagation Division Where to Grow Peace Lily In the wild, peace lilies are tropical plants that thrive on the forest floor, so they love humid environments and dappled sunlight. Humid Spaces Rooms with higher humidity, such as bathrooms with a solar tube or skylight, or those near a north- or east-facing window, provide ideal conditions. Avoid placing your peace lily in direct sunlight because the harsh rays can burn the plant's leaves. If light options are limited in your home, a peace lily can still thrive in low-light conditions but it might not produce the pretty flower-like bracts. Avoid Drafts It is also best to avoid placing your peace lily near heat sources or drafts. Temperature fluctuations caused by fans, vents, air conditioners, open doors, fireplaces, radiators, and space heaters can cause the foliage to droop and wilt. Sheltered Outdoors Outdoors, peace lilies are only hardy in Zones 10-12. If you live in a warmer climate, you can plant mature, divided, or seedling peace lilies in the ground in late winter or early spring. Choose a spot with fertile soil and dappled sunlight (or partial shade) that provides shelter from strong winds. The leaves and flowers of peace lilies are considered toxic to humans.1 They are also toxic to cats and dogs.2Keep these plants away from pets and small children. How and When to Plant Peace Lily If you are planting a peace lily outside, dig a hole twice the size of the plant’s root ball. Place the plant in the hole, fill in the soil, and water thoroughly. You can also grow peace lilies in containers outdoors in these tropical climates. If you are growing a peace lily as a houseplant, you can plant it at any time, but many gardeners choose to plant or repot in the spring. Choose a container just slightly larger than the plant’s root ball. Fill the container two-thirds of the way with well-draining, peat-free houseplant potting soil or houseplant compost. Place your peace lily in the pot and hold it steady while you fill in the rest of the soil or compost. Water well. For a different look, peace lilies can grow in distilled, purified, or rain water alone. Choose a vessel or insert designed to suspend the plant above the waterline. Care Tips for Peace Lily Plant Caring for a peace lily is so simple, it is commonly recommended for first-time houseplant owners. Use these tips to keep your peace lily looking its best. Light Indoors or outdoors, peace lilies perform best in bright, indirect light. They can, however, do well in low-light conditions but will produce fewer spathe flowers and will have a slightly looser growth habit. A peace lily's shiny green foliage looks great even when the plant isn't blooming. To keep your foliage looking its best, wipe down the leaves with a damp cloth occasionally to keep dust from building up. Soil and Water Peace lilies need rich, well-draining potting mix to thrive—ideally with a soil pH between 5.8 and 6.5. They are prone to root rot in soggy or wet soil conditions. Err on the side of under-watering than overwatering with these plants. The amount of water your peace lily needs depends on the size of your container and the drainage capabilities of the soil. As a general guideline, water only when the top inch of the soil is dry and let your plants dry out a bit between waterings. Temperature and Humidity Peace lilies are tropical plants that prefer a warm, humid climate—ideally with a temperature between 65° and 80°F and a humidity level of 50% or higher. Temperatures below 40°F will damage the plant. To increase humidity levels for your peace lily, place a humidifier nearby. The Best Humidifier for Plants, Tested by BHG Fertilizer Give peace lilies an occasional dose of a slow-release fertilizer but don’t overdo it. Limit feedings to every 6 weeks throughout the spring and summer and watch for yellowing or browning in the leaves. Over-fertilization makes peace lilies prone to leaf burn. If you are growing a peace lily plant in water alone, add some liquid fertilizer to the water every 4 to 6 weeks to make up for the loss of soil nutrients. The 9 Best Fertilizers for Indoor Plants, Reviewed by BHG Pruning Peace lilies benefit from regular pruning and deadheading (every six months or as needed). After a stalk has produced a “flower,” it will not produce another one and will eventually turn brown and die. Cut back spent stalks at the base of the plant to make room for new stalks. Then, trim away yellow or shriveled leaves and spathe flowers with scissors or pruning shears. Potting and Repotting Peace lilies like to be a little pot-bound, so plan to repot yours only when you see roots starting to poke out from the bottom of the pot. When you do repot your peace lily, try to remove as much of the old soil as you can and only increase the pot by an inch or two in diameter. Pests and Problems Peace lilies don’t have many issues with pests, but those attracted to moist microclimates can be problematic. If you see evidence of mealybugs, fungus gnats, thrips, scale, and spider mites, it’s best to address them quickly. Allow the soil of your peace lily to dry out a little more between waterings and use an insecticidal soap or neem oil to eradicate the pests. Root rot is another common issue for peace lilies—especially when they are overwatered. It causes yellowing and wilting in the lower foliage as well as brown spots on the leaves and (depending on the type of rot) also on the stalks. Terra-cotta pots absorb excess moisture, helping to prevent root rot. Leaf blight is another issue that is exacerbated by high humidity levels and moist soil conditions. It can create brown or black lesions on the leaves that appear wet and mushy. If you catch it early, you can curtail the disease by removing the affected leaves and repotting the plant in fresh soil and a sterilized pot. The 7 Best Potting Soils How to Propagate Peace Lily The simplest way to propagate peace lilies is via division. Spring is the best time to do this, but if your plant is becoming overly pot-bound, any time will do. Each time you divide a plant, you will need to wait until it has reached maturity and is large enough to separate into multiple sections. To divide your peace lily plant, gently remove the plant from its pot and pry apart the stems into 2 or 3 clumps (making sure each clump has its own set of roots). Replant each of the new divisions in a separate container as you would a new plant. Types of Peace Lily Peace lilies come in different sizes, and a few offer variegated leaves. Here are a few examples. Wallis Peace Lily The most common type of peace lily is Spathiphyllum wallisii, which features large glossy, green leaves and white, calla-like blooms. It can reach up to 3 feet tall indoors. 'Domino' Peace Lily This variety of Spathiphyllum wallisii is a form with variegated foliage. It also blooms, but its main attraction is its green foliage speckled with cream and white. 'Jetty' Peace Lily 'Jetty' is a fast-growing, lush variety of Spathiphyllum with loads of white spathe flowers. 'Mauna Loa' Peace Lily 'Mauna Loa' is a vigorous variety of Spathiphyllum wallisii that grows to 3 feet tall with pure white blooms. 'Sensation' Peace Lily This variety of Spathiphyllum wallisii is a giant among peace lilies, growing up to 6 feet tall, with proportionately large flower bracts. Frequently Asked Questions Why are my peace lily flowers turning green? We call them flowers, but the blooms on peace lilies are technically spathes. The large, white spathe of the peace lily is a modified leaf (called a bract). It protects the spadix, which is the spike of small flowers held upright in the center of the spathe. As these flowers age, the spathe fades to green. However, since the peace lily has little need for fertilizer, the bracts can also turn green when overfed. Is a peace lily related to true lilies? Native to the tropical regions of South America, the peace lily is not actually a true lily. It's a member of the Araceae family—which includes other houseplant favorites like pothos, philodendron, and monstera. Do peace lilies purify the air? Yes and no. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) did a study in the late 1980s3 that indicated that certain plants (like the peace lily) could absorb environmental contaminants such as carbon monoxide and formaldehyde from indoor air. However, that study was conducted in conditions that mimic a sealed spacecraft, not a home. Also, later studies4 have shown that you would need as many as 10 plants per square foot to create a significant filtering effect. In a 1,500-square-foot home, that would be 15,000 plants!"

    "content": "Pothos Plant Features A perfect houseplant for beginners, pothos is one of the easiest you can grow -- and one of the most popular. For many people it's their first houseplant, and often remains their favorite. It's forgiving in its care needs, so you can enjoy it in virtually any room of your home or office, even those interiors that receive only artificial light. Pothos is practically effortless to display. You can grow it in hanging baskets to trail down, let it climb a totem or trellis, or grow horizontally along a tabletop or mantle. The most common form, golden pothos, features dark green leaves splashed and marbled in shades of yellow, cream, or white. It's also one of the fastest-growing varieties. Newer selections (see them at the bottom of this page) show off different variegation patterns, from the green-on-green look of Global Green to the silvery sheen on Cebu Blue. Pothos plants, as they grow and mature, develop larger leaves. While young, immature plants may feature leaves that grow only 3 or 4 inches long, the foliage can be come much larger. Encourage pothos plants to develop larger leaves by giving them bright light, warm temperatures, and letting them grow vertically. Note: Some varieties, including Baltic Blue and Cebu Blue, will develop dramatic cuts, called fenestrations, in the leaves. This makes them look similar to a monstera. Note: Pothos is a common name for the plant. It's botanically known as Epipremnum, though throughout history, it's been reclassified as a Scindapsus, Rhaphidophora, and Pothos. (Botanically, Pothos species are distant cousins of the Epipremnum varieties we enjoy indoors.) But no matter what you call it, this plant is a delightful houseplant! Pothos Questions? Our houseplant experts can help! Just drop us an email. Buy Costa Farms Pothos Find a variety of Costa Farms pothos in our online plant shop or at your favorite local garden center. Check out our retailer partners. Pothos Growing Instructions Pothos requires no special care indoors; it tolerates low light (but grows well in medium- and high-light spots, as well), low humidity, and the occasional missed watering. That said, pothos prefers moist (but not wet or saturated) soil, so it's best to water it when the top couple of inches or so of the potting mix is dry. Because it's such an easy-care houseplant, you don't need to worry about fertilizing pothos a lot. Feed it at least twice a year (every six months or so) with a general-purpose houseplant fertilizer (available from your local garden center). If you wish to fertilize the plant more frequently, you can certainly do so to encourage faster growth. If your pothos grows longer than you'd like, or becomes too lanky, it's easy to trim. Just prune off several inches from the end of a stem. Doing so will encourage it to develop sideshoots, becoming more full and lush. You can prune pothos any time of the year without harming it. When pruning, avoid removing more than about one third of the total leaves at one time. Pruning too hard can cause stress to your pothos. Looking for other low-water houseplants? Here are some of our top picks. This easy-care houseplant is not intended for human or animal consumption. In some subtropical areas, it can be considered an invasive pest. Check local restrictions before growing it outdoors. Water Medium water needs Light Indoors: High light Indoors: Low light Indoors: Medium light Colors Green Variegated Special Features Purifies the air Super-easy to grow Complement your Pothos Dieffenbachia Dieffenbachia and pothos are lovely complements to one another. Arrowhead Plant Arrowhead plant and pothos make a delightful climbing combo! Ponytail Palm Ponytail palm and pothos are perfect, easy-care houseplants to grow together. Q&A My 'Marble Queen' pothos started growing leaves that are all green instead of variegated. Is this normal? All variegated plants -- including 'Marble Queen' pothos -- have the ability to revert to their non-variegated forms. This is a natural occurrence that can happen at any time. Happily, it's nothing to worry about and easy to fix. Just prune out the reverted shoot on your pothos (that way it doesn't take over the entire plant). If you wish to plant it in another pot, you can grow it out or share it with a gardening friend. I've been told pothos likes to be rootbound. How do I know when to repot it? While pothos tolerates being rootbound, or having more than 75 percent of the volume of the pot filled with roots, it doesn't actually enjoy it. You'll find your pothos will grow faster and more happily if you repot as the roots begin to fill the container. When repotting, it's ideal to jump up one pot size at a time -- if you go from a small pot to a large pot, all the extra potting mix around the roots may hold moisture longer than your pothos prefers, causing roots to suffocate, die, and rot."

    "content": "Information Pothos Common names: Pothos, Devil’s ivy, Ceylon creeper, golden pothos, silver vine Botanical name: Epipremnum, Scindapsus, Philodendron Family: Arum (Araceae) Type: Evergreen climber Height: 2 to 20m (7 to 65ft) Aspect: Bright, indirect light Moisture level: Average to high humidity Room temperature: 12 to 26°C (56 to 80°F) Hardiness: H1B Difficulty: Easy to average In the world of houseplants, the name ‘pothos’ refers to several climbing plants, but here we’re mainly talking about Epipremnum aureum. Commonly known as golden pothos, it is a self-clinging evergreen vine, with glossy bright-green ovate leaves that are splashed with cream or gold. Although it hails from just one island (Mo’orea, one of the Society Islands in the Pacific), it has naturalised in forests around the world, including in Australia, South Africa, and the West Indies. After taking root on the forest floor, it pulls itself up trees using self-clinging aerial roots. In some places (such as Sri Lanka), it has made a devastating nuisance of itself, so it should never be planted outside in warm regions where it isn’t native and may run amok. But, as a climbing houseplant, it is superb, being difficult to kill and having been shown to rid the air of harmful indoor pollutants (such as formaldehyde, xylene, and benzene). In the right conditions, it can form columns of greenery and even coat walls in curtains of lush leaves. Where is the best place to put a pothos? Bright indirect light is best for the healthiest, most enthusiastic growth, with large leaves, strong colour, and distinct variegation. Strong direct sun could scorch the leaves. Pothos is known as devil’s ivy because it remains green in deep shade; however, although it will tolerate very low light, growth will be slow, the leaves will remain small, and variegated forms could revert to the colour of the parent species. The ‘pothos’ that perform best in low, indirect light are the Philodendron varieties. Good air circulation is great, but keep the plant well away from draughts, as well as radiators and dehumidifiers. Humidity is preferable, but not necessary. They will perform best in the room temperatures that we feel comfortable in, but their toleration range is 12 to 26°. How to make pothos leaves huge Pothos are climbing plants that pull themselves up trees in the wild. When they are given a structure to climb – as well as the right care and conditions – their leaves can grow very big (up to 90cm). When the plant is young, usually the best option is to plunge a coir pole into the pot. Despite being self-clinging vines, pothos usually need help by being regularly tied in. Once the plant is a good size, it can be tricky to remove it from its original support – in which case, repot it, providing a second structure to climb, alongside the existing nursery pole. This can be anything sturdy: if you want a frame, consider a wall trellis or, in a large room, ornate salvaged iron gates or doors; if you prefer one central support, a metal obelisk is ideal or a salvaged pillar, post, or column could provide a beautiful floor to ceiling column. Do pothos prefer to climb or hang? Pothos look beautiful trailing from a container hung from the ceiling or sat atop a high shelf or cabinet. However, their leaves won’t be as big if they can’t climb. A combination of climbing and trailing looks fabulous, once the plant reaches a certain size. In Brighton, houseplant enthusiast Asha Kirkby sent her 14-year-old pothos climbing to the ceiling of her living room and then employed a system of hooks and string to support the plant around the tops of the walls, just under the cornice. ‘It grows all around the room – stretching 16 metres, but the stems cascade down intermittently from the main growth, so the plant is longer than that,’ she says. ‘I stuck large hooks into the wall, near the high ceiling, at 1.5 metre intervals, and then tied her to the hooks using strong garden twine. The new ends of the plant need threading through every 1 to 2 months.’ How often to water a pothos Water when the upper half of the compost is dry (usually every 1 to 2 weeks in summer); if the pot feels relatively light when lifted or the leaves begin to droop, it needs a drink. When watered, the compost should be thoroughly moist, but let the excess water drain out after watering; don’t leave the plant sitting in a tray of water for long periods. Overwatering is the worst thing you can do to a pothos: waterlogging could lead to poor growth, rotting, or susceptibility to pests (such as spider mite and mealybugs). They will tolerate drought, but prefer to be watered when necessary. A lot less watering is required during winter. Philodendron forms of ‘pothos’ tend to need a bit more watering than Epipremnum and Scindapsus. Should you mist a pothos? Because golden pothos grows in wet tropical forest in the wild, it loves the moist air of a bathroom or kitchen. It is incredibly resilient, so it will tolerate rooms with low to average humidity, but it’s best to boost humidity in those places, either by sitting the plant on a tray of pebbles and water or by regularly misting it. If your pothos is growing up a coir pole, you could also spray that with water. What is the best way to grow a pothos? Feed it Fertilise with nitrogen-rich liquid food once a fortnight during spring and summer. Without sufficient food, growth won’t be as vigorous, the leaves won’t be as big, and variegated plants could revert to the form of their parent species. Once a year, remove the upper layer of compost, and replace with fresh peat-free compost. Prune it Cut the plant back to boost bushiness if it has become too leggy for your liking; a regular trim at any time of year will help to maintain lush, healthy growth, although spring and summer are the optimum seasons to do it. The closer to the base of the plant you cut, the bushier it will grow back. Volumise it If the plant looks thin and leggy, prune it (as above) or pin a few sections up at the base. Use plant, floristry, or hair pins to attach the node (lumpy protrusion) of a long section up onto the compost; this immediately creates a fuller looking plant, and the pinned sections will produce roots. Repot it Since pothos really enjoy being a little pot-bound, only transfer into a bigger container when absolutely necessary. Use multipurpose peat-free compost mixed with coir or moss. Variegation If your variegated pothos has started to revert back to the colour of its parent species, cut out the reverted growth; move the plant to a position that has bright indirect light and feed it regularly. Propagation New plants are easy to make via stem cuttings taken in spring or summer. Cut a length of trail and then section it into the pieces you need, using a sharp, clean pair of secateurs. Cut a few centimetres above and below a node (the lumpy bit on the stem, close to a leaf), so that you are left with a node and a leaf. Cut the upper end horizontal and the lower end at an angle, so you remember which is which. Then insert 10 to 20 of these little cuttings into the same pot of moist compost, plunging the lower ends (cut at an angle) in. If you only use a few, you won’t produce a generous, bushy plant. Keep the compost moist (but never waterlogged) for the first month; then revert to the scant watering that mature pothos enjoy. It’s also worth boosting the humidity for the first month (by misting, sitting the pot on a tray of pebbles and water, or placing it in a bright bathroom), but once they are established, such humidity is not necessary. Safety Pothos is toxic to dogs and cats. It is also mildly toxic to humans, so be careful if you have young children, and wear gloves and long sleeves when handling the plant to prevent skin irritation. What is a pothos? Although Epipremnum aureum may take centre stage, other plants are included under the umbrella term ‘pothos’. They are mainly Epipremnum pinnatum (the money plant), Scindapsus pictus (silver vine), and Philodendron hederaceum (syn. Philodendron scandens; heart leaf). It all gets rather incestuous and confusing because Epipremnum pinnatum used to be known as Philodendron epipremnum, and Epipremnum aureum used to be classed as Scindapsus aureus and, before that, was originally labelled Pothos aureus – which is why it is still referred to as ‘pothos’ today, even though Pothos is in fact a different genus. Retailers offer a plethora of varieties stemming from these four species and, while they vary ever so slightly in shape, colour, patterning, and texture, they look very similar and their growing requirements are identical, so they are all referred to as pothos. If you pick up a trailing plant with large heart-shaped leaves in a houseplant shop, it’s probably a pothos. Which pothos to grow The principal species, Epipremnum aureum, has smooth, glossy green ovate leaves marbled with gold or cream. But there are many varieties of pothos available with wonderful foliage colours and markings. Scindapsus pictus ‘Argyraeus’ produces neat fir-green leaves with grey blotches; Scindapsus pictus ‘Trebie’ enchanting silver leaves are marked green; Epipremnum aureum ‘Njoy’ is a striking green and cream-white; Epipremnum aureum ‘Neon’ is a cheering shade of golden lime; Epipremnum pinnatum Marble Planet has rough-textured emerald leaves; and Epipremnum aureum ‘Global Green’ is a lush combination of dark green and apple green. Most have an ovate heart leaf shape, but some (such as glaucous Epipremnum pinnatum ‘Cebu Blue’) are markedly more lanceolate. Philodendron leaves are thinner, smoother, and have more of a distinct heart shape, with a pointed tip, and, when variegated, the colouring tends to be more defined and distinct. Also new growth on a Philodendron can be pinkish or reddish, and they tend to be leggier. Philodendron ‘Lemon Lime’ is a vivid shade of green yellow, and Philodendron hederaceum ‘Brasil’ has two-tone green and lime leaves. When shopping, always choose a bushy, healthy-looking plant that has lots of base stems (ideally, 10 or more) emerging from the compost."

But indoors, it is one of the most popular houseplants in the United States, thanks in part to the fact that caring for a pothos plant is a piece of cake. Pothos Watering More than a few plant owners confuse low care with no care, so take note that pothos has a few absolute rules. For one, it requires water and grows best during spring and summer when the soil is kept consistently moist. Take the drainage requirement to heart though, since a pothos sitting in soggy soil is not a happy plant. Pothos Light Requirements Pothos plants make a great addition to your bathroom or office because they can tolerate low light. While pothos likes a wide variety of light conditions, they do not do well in direct sunlight. That brings us to the second absolute for pothos: no direct sun. When the lovely heart-shaped leaves get direct sunlight, especially in the afternoon, they brown and die. Otherwise, pothos is flexible about sunlight requirements. A responsible pothos owner can put the plant in total shade location and it will continue to thrive for some time. Ideally, light shade or dappled sun are the best options. If your pothos is highly variegated — particularly variegated with white — they may either not grow as well in low light or may lose their variegation if the light is too low. Only the green parts of the leaves can make energy for the plant, so it must be able to get enough light for energy or its growth will slow or the leaves will compensate for the lack of light by becoming more green. Pothos Soil Requirements Some plants are picky about soil, but pothos is not one of them. Pothos plants grow perfectly well in ordinary soil as long as it drains well. That means that loamy or sandy soil will work, while clay will not. If the soil is constantly saturated, pothos will die. Pothos can be grown in water or in dry soil, which makes it a very popular houseplant. Cuttings can be taken from a mother plant, rooted in water, and kept kept growing in water indefinitely. This is convenient for placing a pothos plant in hard to reach areas in a jug of water where it can remain untouched as long as water remains in the jug. On the opposite end, pothos can also be started in soil and will tolerate moderate periods of dry soil with little effect to the plant. Oddly enough, cuttings started in one growing medium have a hard time switching to the other. So, a pothos plant started in soil has a hard time thriving if moved to water, and a pothos cutting started in water will not do very well in soil, especially if it has spent a long period of time growing in water. Fertilizing Pothos What about fertilizer as part of pothos care? Some experts suggest fertilizing a pothos every other month during the growing season, some every three months year round. This will help it grow more quickly. But pothos plants are naturally fast growers, and they will do perfectly well and live a long time without any fertilizer at all. Problems, Pests & Diseases Yet another great feature about these philodendron look-alikes? They are virtually pest free. You may find the occasional mealybug or a few scales, but this is the exception and not the rule. Overwatering or planting in clay soil will result in root rot, while direct afternoon sun will burn the lovely leaves. Word of warning: Don’t eat a pothos plant. Don’t even nibble! All parts of this plant from leaves to roots are poisonous to humans, dogs, cats and livestock. Repotting Pothos Plants Most plants can outgrow their containers over time, so it is no surprise that you may need to repot as part of your care of pothos plants. Some experts recommend annual repotting, but our staff has a pothos plant that's lived in the same container for years with no complaints. If you do decide that pothos repotting is required, you can opt to keep the same container and root prune instead. The plant gets more soil in either case. How to Propagate Pothos If you have a pothos, you'll have no trouble obtaining more plants. Pothos roots easily from cuttings in water, so you can make as many plants as you like just by snipping and rooting stem cuttings. Check Out Our Complete Guide to Houseplants Are Pothos Plants Toxic? While pothos is an easy to care for houseplant, you do need to be aware that it is poisonous. Though rarely fatal, ingestion of the plant can cause irritation and vomiting due to the fact that it contains calcium oxalates. Even the sap from the plant may cause highly sensitive people to break out in a rash. Pothos is considered toxic to cats, dogs, and humans, so it should be kept out of reach of pets and children. Though pothos poisoning will make you very sick, it is unlikely to lead to death. That being said, if you suspect pothos poisoning, you should seek medical or veterinary attention immediately. Pothos Varieties A number of interesting pothos varieties have been developed and are available in commerce. These include the extremely popular 'Golden Pothos', with its yellow variegated leaves. But that’s far from all. You can find varieties with dark green leaves like ‘Jade’, and varieties with all yellow or yellow-green leaves - ‘Neon’ or ‘Lime’ respectively. 'Marble Queen' is particularly lovely since both foliage and stems are marbled with white.'"

    "content": "About the Phalaenopsis Orchid Native to the tropical forests of Southeast Asia, the Phalaenopsis Orchid, often referred to as the Moth Orchid, graces any space with its elegant, butterfly-like blooms. Its glossy leaves and striking flowers can bloom for several months, adding a touch of sophistication to your home. Potted in an easyplant self-watering pot, it receives the consistent care it needs to thrive. While reblooming orchids traditionally requires patience and precision, the easyplant system creates the ideal environment for reblooming. Other common names Moon Orchid Moth Orchid How Often Should I Water My Phalaenopsis Orchid? With easyplant, caring for your Phalaenopsis Orchid is wonderfully simple. Just check the easyplant reservoir once every two months and refill it when empty - and you're all set! Known for its graceful blooms and elegant arching stems, this orchid thrives in consistent conditions, and the easyplant system takes the guesswork out of watering. If you're not using an easyplant pot, it's important to pay close attention to your watering routine. Phalaenopsis Orchids prefer their roots to dry slightly between waterings but not remain dry for extended periods. As a general rule, water when the potting medium feels dry about an inch below the surface. Be careful not to overwater, as orchid roots are prone to rot. During colder months, or in lower light conditions, reduce watering frequency to match the plant’s slower growth. Phalaenopsis Orchid Light Needs Phalaenopsis Orchid grows best in a space with bright indirect light, where the sun rays are diffused. Avoid placing it in spaces with harsh direct sunlight, which can scorch its delicate leaves and flowers, or in spaces without natural light. The ideal spot is near an east-facing window where it can enjoy gentle morning sun or in a well-lit room with filtered light. If natural light is limited, this orchid can also do well under grow lights or fluorescent bulbs, making it suitable for office spaces or lower-light interiors. Proper lighting is essential to encourage blooming and support the orchid’s graceful, arching stems. Phalaenopsis Orchid Care On your Phalaenopsis Orchid’s first few days at home, it may drop a bloom or two as it adjusts to its new surroundings. This is completely normal and nothing to worry about. Once acclimated, your orchid will continue to thrive and reward you with stunning, long-lasting flowers. As with many flowering plants, your orchid will benefit from gentle 'dead-heading' - simply remove any faded blooms to help redirect energy toward new growth. To support healthy development, rotate the pot by a ¼ turn once a month to ensure even light exposure. Keep the leaves free of dust by wiping them gently with a damp cloth, and avoid placing the orchid in a spot with sudden temperature changes or strong drafts. With a little attention, your Phalaenopsis Orchid will remain an elegant, blooming beauty all year round. How Often Do Phalaenopsis Orchids Bloom? Phalaenopsis Orchids are loved for their long-lasting, elegant blooms, which can stay vibrant for up to three months. Once the final flower drops, don’t worry - your orchid isn’t finished, it’s just entering a natural rest period. During this time, continue to care for it as usual, keeping it in a spot with bright, indirect light and stable warmth. You have two options for the spent flower spike: either trim it just above a visible node (a small bump along the stem) to encourage a possible secondary spike, or cut the spike all the way down to the base to help the plant focus its energy on root and leaf development. Patience is key - your orchid may take a few months to prepare for its next blooming cycle. To encourage new blooms, maintain consistent care and consider placing the orchid in a slightly cooler environment at night (around 60–65°F) for a few weeks. This gentle temperature drop can signal the plant to initiate a new flower spike. With the right balance of light, temperature, and time, your Phalaenopsis Orchid will reward you with another round of stunning blooms. How Big Will my Phalaenopsis Orchid Grow? Phalaenopsis Orchids grow slowly and steadily, focusing their energy on producing long-lasting blooms rather than rapid foliage expansion. When grown indoors under ideal conditions—bright, indirect light and stable humidity—each flower spike can reach up to 18–24 inches tall, arching gracefully with several blooms at a time. While the foliage remains compact, typically no more than 6–12 inches tall, the plant will develop additional leaves and roots over time. New flower spikes usually appear once or twice a year, especially after a rest period following the fall of previous blooms. With patience and proper care, a mature Phalaenopsis Orchid can bloom for months at a time and continue to flourish for many years. To encourage reblooming, ensure consistent light, avoid overwatering, and consider trimming old flower spikes just above a node once blooming has finished. Temperature & Humidity Phalaenopsis Orchids thrive in warm, humid environments that mirror their tropical origins. The ideal temperature range is between 65°F and 80°F. These orchids are sensitive to temperature extremes, so avoid placing them near drafty windows, air vents, or heaters. As for humidity, they prefer moderate to high levels - ideally around 50–70%. In drier indoor spaces, especially during the winter months, you can increase humidity by using a humidifier, placing the pot on a pebble tray filled with water (without letting the pot sit directly in the water), or grouping your orchid with other humidity-loving plants. Maintaining steady warmth and air moisture will help your orchid stay healthy and bloom beautifully. Is Phalaenopsis Orchid Toxic for Pets & Kids? Phalaenopsis Orchids are non-toxic and safe for both humans and animals. This makes them an excellent choice for households with curious pets or small children. While it's always a good idea to keep any plant out of reach to avoid accidental damage or nibbling, you can rest easy knowing that the Phalaenopsis Orchid won’t pose a risk if touched or accidentally ingested in small amounts. However, as with any non-edible plant, ingestion in large quantities may cause mild stomach discomfort, so it's still best to keep your orchid in a safe, elevated spot. Troubleshooting Common Problems with Phalaenopsis Orchid Phalaenopsis Orchids are relatively easy to care for, but like all plants, they may show signs of stress if conditions aren't ideal. If you notice wrinkled or leathery leaves, this often indicates underwatering - check the easyplant reservoir to ensure it's not empty, and if you're using a regular pot, make sure the roots aren't staying dry for too long. Yellowing leaves, especially near the base, can be a normal part of the plant's life cycle, but if several leaves begin yellowing at once, it may be a sign of overwatering. Let the reservoir fully empty before refilling and ensure the plant gets enough indirect light. Brown or crispy leaf tips usually suggest low humidity or exposure to dry air - placing the plant near a humidifier or on a pebble tray can help bring moisture back to the environment. If buds fall off before opening - a condition called bud blast - it’s likely caused by sudden temperature shifts, drafts, or fluctuations in humidity. In these cases, make sure your orchid is in a warm, stable spot with bright, indirect light. A lack of reblooming may simply mean your plant is resting, but if it continues for many months, consider moving it to a brighter location and exposing it to slightly cooler nighttime temperatures to encourage a new bloom cycle. Lastly, if you notice sticky residue, yellow spotting, or fine webbing, it could be a sign of pests like mealybugs or spider mites - gently wipe the leaves clean and treat with neem oil or insecticidal soap if needed. With the right care and close attention, your orchid will bounce back and continue to flourish beautifully Frequently Asked Questions about Phalaenopsis Orchid Plant How many times a year do Phalaenopsis Orchid bloom? Close How many times a year do Phalaenopsis Orchid bloom? Phalaenopsis Orchids typically bloom once or twice a year, but with easyplant, some will surprise you with more! Should my orchid’s roots be sticking out of the pot? Close Should my orchid’s roots be sticking out of the pot? Yes, it’s completely normal! Orchids are epiphytes, which means they naturally grow on trees in the wild rather than in soil. As a result, they often develop aerial roots that extend outside the pot. These exposed roots help the plant breathe and absorb moisture from the air, just like they would in their natural habitat. There's no need to trim them or push them back into the pot. Healthy aerial roots are a sign your orchid is thriving. What to do with a Phalaenopsis orchid after flowering? Close What to do with a Phalaenopsis orchid after flowering? Once the last bloom drops, don’t worry - your orchid is just resting. You can trim the flower spike to a node or all the way down. Keep caring for it, and a new bloom will likely follow! How do I care for a Phalaenopsis orchid? Close How do I care for a Phalaenopsis orchid? Place it in bright, indirect light and keep the easyplant reservoir full about once every two months. Avoid cold drafts, and give it a little extra humidity - it’ll thank you with blooms. Where is the best place to put a Phalaenopsis orchid? Close Where is the best place to put a Phalaenopsis orchid? A spot with bright, indirect light - like near an east-facing window- is perfect. Keep it away from harsh sun or cold drafts."

    "content": "The Orchid is one of the most popular indoor plants. It is a beautiful addition to all homes with the vast range of colours and sizes that they come in. With the right care, they will give a delightful, long-lasting flower display. Here are some top tips on how to care for your orchid. Plastic pot It is important to keep Orchids in a clear plastic pot. This is because it allows the light to get into the roots, which mimics an Orchids natural habitat. You can put the clear plastic pot inside a decorative ceramic pot, but it is important that the ceramic pot is a little larger than the plastic pot so that airflow can get to the Orchid roots. Light Orchids will flower best if they are placed somewhere warm with some light. However, they don’t like to be in direct sunlight as this may scorch their leaves. It is said that an east to south facing windowsill is the ideal location for an Orchid to get the right amount of light. Maintain temperatures above 15C in winter. Watering and Feeding One of the most common problems people find Orchid care is over-watering. An Orchid does not need much water, which is where a lot of people can go wrong as too much water means the roots become too soft and soggy. Do not let your Orchid stand in water for longer than an hour as roots will rot, and avoid getting water in the crown of the plant. Westland Orchid Water is a good solution for this common issue. With this specially filtered and nutrient rich water, you just need to water the Orchid with one capsule, twice a week. This controls watering and feeding to the correct level for optimum growth and beautiful flowers. Feed Orchid plants regularly in summer with Orchid Feed. They ideally need feeding every two weeks in spring and summer, and every 4 weeks in autumn and winter. Extending its life and re-potting Once the first flush of flowers fades, cut the flower spike back to a side shoot to ensure a further display. If the whole flower stem dies, remove it and wait for another to arise. Orchids do not need regular re-potting but probably only every 2 years. An Orchid needs re-potting when all of the roots look compacted. The best time to re-pot an Orchid is in the spring. To re-pot you need another clear pot which is about an inch bigger than the original one and some peat free Westland Orchid Potting Mix. The potting mix uses clever clay granules which soak up and hold on to the water, while also giving the Orchid roots better airflow. Re-potting is simple because all you do is remove the Orchid from the original pot into the bigger pot, which has some of the orchid potting mix in the bottom. Once the Orchid is in the pot, fill the sides with the potting mix and tap the pot to settle the compost. As long as these basic factors are met and followed, then it makes caring for an Orchid super easy and results in wonderful, long-lasting flowers."

    "content": "Orchids (Orchidaceae) are popular houseplants with thousands of species to choose from—including some common ones that you've probably heard of, such as Phalaenopsis, Cattleya, Dendrobium, and Cymbidium. Orchids can be pretty easy to care for if you provide the writer growing conditions—and thankfully, most have the same needs. Read on to learn more about how to care for orchids so you can have healthy plants with spectacular blooms. Common Name Orchid, moth orchid, corsage orchid, boat orchid Family Orchidaceae Plant Type Perennial, herbaceous Mature Size 1–3 ft. tall, 6–12 in. wide Sun Exposure Partial shade Soil Type Well-drained Soil pH Acidic Bloom Time Varies Flower Color Pink, purple, white, red, yellow, orange, green Hardiness Zones 5–11 (USDA) Native Area North America, South America, Central America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, Caribbean Orchid Care When you first get your orchid, it will likely be healthy and in bloom. Once the bloom falls off, the plant isn't doomed for the trash can. You can care for the orchid and get it to re-bloom. Follow these care tips to keep an orchid alive and thriving: Choose a location with plenty of bright, indirect light; a south- or east-facing window is ideal. Allow the growing medium to dry out completely between waterings. Use lightweight, airy growing media designed for orchids; do not plant in potting soil. Feed with an orchid-specific fertilizer or a balanced fertilizer formula such as 20-20-20 at a diluted strength. Reduce fertilization during the months that your species of orchid is dormant after flowering (typically in winter). Light Orchids need bright light to produce blooms, so give the plants as many hours as possible of bright, indirect light, ideally in a south- or east-facing window. Be careful of direct sun, as it can burn the plants. Soil Orchids need an orchid-specific growing medium that is particularly lightweight and fast-draining, which is usually a mix of bark, sphagnum moss, perlite, and peat. You can purchase a pre-made mix or make your own. Do not use regular potting soil or potting mix. Orchids will not thrive in regular potting soil or potting mix. Slightly acidic soil pH is ideal. Water Orchids need to dry out between waterings to prevent rot. If the growing medium feels dry to the touch and the pot feels light, it's probably time to water. Orchids typically need water twice a week in the warmer months when the plant is actively growing and only once a week or less in the colder months. Use room-temperature water, and water slowly until it flows out of the pot's drainage openings. Before watering, look at the roots themselves. If they’re plump and white or green, that means they’re already well-watered. If they’re shriveled and gray, then they're thirsty. If they’re shriveled but spongey and black or brown, they might be rotting. Temperature and Humidity Depending how they're classified, orchids do best in ranges between 50ºF and 90ºF. They prefer humidity levels from around 40 to 70 percent. You can keep an orchid blooming longer if you provide a warm and somewhat humid environment. Don't place your orchid where it will experience cold drafts, exposure to direct sunlight, or dry air from heating vents. Fertilizer During the growing season, which for most orchids is spring and summer, use an orchid-specific fertilizer, following label instructions. Don't fertilize during the winter months. Air Circulation Orchids require good air circulation for healthy growth. If you've seen an orchid display, you'll notice each pot and plant has plenty of room around it; you shouldn't place orchids in among a group of plants. Set it somewhere it won't touch other plants. You don't want the air around it to be stagnant, but you also don't want it to be cold or hot (as it would be if it were blowing from a vent). Is this the right plant for you? AN ORCHID IS A GOOD CHOICE IF: You have a south or east-facing window that can provide adequate light You're a houseplant enthusiast looking for a plant that repeatedly blooms You like a challenging houseplant to flex your green thumb Orchid Care After Flowering After your orchid finishes flowering and flower petals drop, snip off the old flower spike (the flower spike it toward the top of the stem—don't cut off the entire stem). You can also repot your plant into a more suitable container with a light, porous growing medium and a pot that allows for good airflow, such as unglazed clay or a pot specially designed for orchids with holes in its sides. You do not necessarily have to repot after an orchid is done flowering, but this is a safe time to do so. Repotting during other periods of an orchids' life cycle can inhibit flowering. Types of Orchids About 30,000 species of orchids live in the wild along with more than 100,000 registered hybrids. Knowing the orchid variety you have is essential for its care. The majority of commonly-available orchid groups for purchase are: Phalaenopsis (moth orchids) have round flowers with a pronounced lip that grow on a single tall stalk arising from a whorl of fleshy, oval leaves. Flowers are usually white, purple, pink, or a combination. Dendrobium (cane orchids) have small flowers that grow in rows on stalks that rise from thick canes, often with several flower clusters per plant. Flowers are typically white or purple. Dendrobium leaves are narrow and emerge from the sides of the cane. Cattleya (corsage orchids) are the most frequently used orchids in corsages, Cattleya orchids have been widely hybridized, leading to a large variety of colors and forms. Some varieties are quite fragrant and many have appealing freckles, streaks, or other bicolor features. Cymbidium (boat orchids) have multiple flower spikes to ensure a satisfying display. Good choices for beginners include the lime green 'Chica', the yellow and red 'Showoff', or the bright pink 'Frae', all recipients of the American Orchid Society’s Highly Commended Certificate. Pruning Orchids Pruning an orchid allows it to have the energy for more flowers. Be sure to use a sharp and clean pruning tool to keep the risk of infection to a minimum. Though different orchids require different pruning methods, it's generally safe to remove spent orchid flowers to refocus the plant's energy on growing new flowers. For most orchid varieties, you can cut off the flower spike after flowering is complete. Some orchids (Phalaenopsis) may re-bloom on the same flower spike, if the spike is still green. Once it turns brown, it's safe to remove. Pruning Tip No pruners? No problem! We've tested and determined the top-rated pruners to help you choose the right one for your comfort and personal needs—there's an option for everyone. Propagating Orchids Propagating orchids by seed is notoriously difficult, because the minuscule seeds need extremely specific conditions that are hard to duplicate. The most common way to propagate an orchid is by division: Moisten the growing medium to make it easier to remove the plant from the container. Examine the roots of the orchid, and remove damaged or dead parts that appear black, mushy, or paper-thin. Healthy roots are firm and plump. Tease apart some of the roots and stems. If they won't separate by hand, use a sharp, sterile cutting tool. Repot each plant in new orchid growing medium, stake if necessary, and water. Tips for Buying in Store Check the roots. Orchid roots should be thick and relatively firm, not dry and wilted or soft and soggy. Roots should also be green. Assess the leaves and stems. Leaves should be green, not have any discoloration or spots and blemishes, and stems should be upright (not limp). Potting and Repotting Orchids If the orchid's roots are growing out of the pot excessively or the growing medium has completely broken down, it’s time to repot. Wait until you're sure your plant is done flowering before repotting your orchid. Never repot an orchid while it's in bloom, just reduce the amount of water it receives until the blooms fade. Remove from its container. Gently remove the orchid from its old container, moistening the growing medium as necessary to make it easier to slide the plant out. Prune damaged roots. Cut away any dead or damaged roots with a sterile cutting tool. Place in larger container. Set the orchid in the slightly larger container, and fill around the roots with fresh growing medium. Stake the orchid. Because the roots won't be anchored to the medium yet, stake the plant if necessary to help it stay upright. Care for as usual. Place the orchid in bright, indirect light and keep the soil moist. Eventually, new roots will grow throughout the medium and attach to the pot anchoring the orchid. Tips When repotting, always choose an appropriate orchid pot to promote healthy growth: Clear plastic pots with multiple slots allow water to drain away and allow you to see the roots. Place the pots in a more attractive ceramic pot. Terracotta is an inexpensive, popular choice, because it dries out quickly. Specialty orchid pots have holes on the sides of the pot to allow air circulation around the roots. When purchasing one of these pots make sure that the holes aren’t so big the potting medium will fall out. How to Get Orchids to Bloom and Rebloom An orchid should bloom at least once a year, though species vary in their bloom cycles. Flowers generally last, on average, two to four months. If your orchid won't bloom, some varieties like Phalaenopsis can be stimulated to bloom by dropping the temperature down for a few nights. The most reliable way to ensure re-bloom is to provide the proper light, moisture, temperature, humidity, food, and growing medium. Common Pests & Plant Diseases Orchids don't tend to have major pest problems. But they can be appetizing for common plant pests, including aphids, fungus gnats, mealybugs, spider mites, scale, thrips, and whiteflies.1 Most pests can be eliminated with a gentle brush of the hand, a jet of water, or spraying them with insecticidal soap. Another solution to control insect populations is neem oil, which can smother pests. In addition to root rot from overwatering, orchids also can become afflicted with various fungal diseases, such as anthracnose, phytophthora (black spots on leaves), botrytis, leaf algae, and petal blight.1 Pest What to Look For How to Treat Aphids Small, pear-shaped insect in green, yellow, red, or black Spray with insecticidal soap or neem oil Fungus gnats Small flies, eggs and larvae in plant soil Keep soil very dry and water with equal parts hydrogen peroxide and water Mealybugs Small, white, oval-shaped insects and powdery wax substances on stems Spray with water, insecticidal soap, or neem oil Spider mites Red, yellow, green, or black tiny spider-like insects and fine white webbing on leaves Spray with water, insecticidal soap, or neem oil Thrips Tiny winged insects with slender bodies Prune affected leaves, spray with water or neem oil Whiteflies Small moth-like insects and white, cone-shaped eggs Spray with water or insecticidal soap, use sticky traps Common Problems With Orchids Once an orchid finds a suitable spot and falls into a routine, the plant should produce healthy growth and reward you with a beautiful bloom. However, subpar conditions can result in some common problems. Leaves Shriveled and Wrinkled Shriveled and wrinkled leaves indicate that the orchid is not receiving enough water. The culprit is often unhealthy roots. If the roots are black and mushy, use a sterile cutting tool to remove the bad roots, and repot the orchid in a new growing medium. If the roots are plump and white or green, but the leaves are shriveled the plant is being under-watered. Leaves Turning Yellow Overwatering and root rot are often the cause of yellowing leaves.2 Give the orchid growing medium time to dry out between waterings. If that doesn't work, repot the plant and remove any unhealthy roots. Drooping Leaves If the leaves are drooping, you may be underwatering the orchid. Orchids thrive with consistent levels of moisture. Another cause is too little light. Move the orchid to a spot with bright, indirect light. Buds Dropping If buds drop before they bloom, the plant is under stress. Investigate the orchid's environment and perhaps move it to a better spot. Look for the following possible issues and environmental conditions that might be affecting the plant: Under-watered or over-watered Swings in temperature due to a heating vent, air conditioner, or other drafts Nearby chemical fumes (paint or gas, for example) Placement near plants or fruits that are producing ethylene gas Low-humidity Yellow or Brown Flowering Stems The flowering stems can turn yellow or brown due to overwatering, sunburn from harsh light, lack of nutrients, or fungal infestation. Remember, it is normal for older flowering stems to turn brown after the blooms have fallen off."

ZZ plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia), also known as the eternity plant, can be the perfect option for you. This tropical plant, with its upright growth, and shiny, oval-shaped, deep green leaves, is perfect for keeping indoors and can grow in practically any environment—whether it be low light, low humidity, or an office desk situation—so its reputation is very strong for beginner plant parents. If you're new to caring for plants or are looking for a low-lift addition to your existing collection, go with the ZZ plant. Just keep in mind that ZZ plants are toxic to people and pets when ingested.1 Common Name ZZ Plant, Zanzibar Gem, Eternity Plant, Aroid Palm Botanical Name Zamioculcas zamiifolia Family Araceae Plant Type Tropical perennial Mature Size 2- to 4-feet tall and wide Sun Exposure Bright to low indirect light Soil Type Well-draining Soil pH 6.0 - 7.0 Bloom Time Spring Flower Color Yellow-brown spadix Hardiness Zones USDA 9 to 10 Native Area Eastern Africa Toxicity Toxic to people and pets1 How to Grow ZZ Plants ZZ plants are low-maintenance houseplants even beginner gardeners can keep alive. Other than a pot with adequate drainage and a location away from cold drafts, these plants don't require much. They thrive even in almost complete shade. Give ZZ plant at least a little indirect light daily for optimum growth and health. Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Plants can survive months without water. Protect ZZ plant from temperatures below 45°F. Dust the Leaves Properly ZZ plants have naturally shiny leaves that accumulate dust and can look dull over time. Use a damp washcloth to clean your plant and restore its shine instead of a commercial leaf shine product which clog the plant's pores. Want more gardening tips? Sign up for our free gardening newsletter for our best-growing tips, troubleshooting hacks, and more! Light ZZ plants are so easy to care for that they can technically survive (though barely) without any natural light. However, they do best in bright, indirect light; if they don't receive enough light, ZZ plants can become leggy. Avoid direct sunlight as this can scorch your plant's leaves. Soil Standard houseplant potting mixes are sufficient for a ZZ plant as long as they drain well. Soil Tip Looking for the best soils for indoor plants? We tested 7 top-rated soils in our Lab to make sure your indoor plants stay happy and healthy. Water Let ZZ plant soil dry out completely in between waterings, then water deeply. Every few weeks should be sufficient, though it depends on the growing conditions. It's better to underwater a ZZ plant than overwater it, since the drought-tolerant plant is able to store water in its rhizomes. Temperature and Humidity ZZ plants are content to grow in average indoor temperatures and humidity. They do not tolerate cold temperatures and can suffer damage below 45°F. Choose a spot away from drafts including cold air vents. Plants may benefit from increased humidity during dry winter months. Fertilizer ZZ plants do not require regular fertilizing, but for optimal health, feed with an indoor formula diluted to half-strength once or twice during its active growing season. Is This the Right Plant for You? A ZZ plant is a good choice for you if... you live somewhere with temperatures above 45°F. you'd prefer not to water the plant very often. you live in a low-light home and need a plant that can tolerate that. Varieties of ZZ Plants Zamioculcas zamiifolia ‘Raven’: A relatively new variety distinguished by dark purple-maroon foliage. Zamioculcas zamiifolia ‘Variegated’: Features green foliage with white, and yellow variegation. Variegation fades if not given adequate light. ZZ Plant Tips for Beginners Where to Put It: Place your ZZ plant in a location that receives some indirect light, and away from cold drafts How to Water It: ZZ plants can survive months without water in certain growing conditions; water your plant only when the soil has dried out completely Soil Type: Plant your ZZ in a well-draining soil, like a standard houseplant mix Pruning A little judicious pruning keeps ZZ plant from getting leggy and thin-looking. Stems can be tipped, removing only a few inches to form a pleasing staggered structure and create a fuller appearance. Use a sharp, sterile pruner and make cuts at a 45º angle just above a leaf node. Use cuttings to start new plants. Remove the bottom leaves as they age and start to fade. Propagating ZZ Plant ZZ plants are propagated through division and leaf cuttings. Division is simplest and can be done during repotting. Pull the rhizomes apart, being careful to preserve as many roots as possible, and repot them separately in their own pots. Growing a ZZ plant from a leaf cutting takes six to nine months as you'll have to wait for a new rhizome to grow and develop new top growth. Leaf cuttings need to develop a root system so you'll need some patience using this propagation technique. Take a cutting from a mature ZZ plant with a portion of stem and at least two leaves, then plant the stem in a well-draining soil mix. Place the cutting in a warm spot that receives bright indirect light, and water thoroughly. Tips for Buying in Store Check for pests.Signs include spots on the leaves, flying insects in the soil, and webbing on the underside of the leaves. Inspect the roots.Make sure they aren't dense and in a large clump, and that there aren't too many roots coming out of the drainage holes. Read the plant label.Be sure you understand the care requirements and have a good spot for the plant in your home. Potting and Repotting ZZ Plant ZZ plants should be repotted only once they have outgrown their previous container. These houseplants tolerate some crowding but need attention when rhizomes start to press against the edge of the container. Repot in spring or summer when your plant is actively growing to alleviate transplant shock. Choose a pot one size larger than the current pot or divide the plant, removing outside rhizomes. You can replant the mother plant in its original container with new potting medium. Warning If you are known to have sensitive skin, preempt any issues by wearing gloves when repotting; ZZ plant sap is known to cause irritation in sensitive individuals. Common Pests and Plant Diseases ZZ plants are not prone to pests but can attract common houseplant pests including mealy bugs, scale, fungus gnats, and aphids. Keep plants free of dust and apply horticultural oil if an infestation develops. Water-soaked lesions and brown spots with yellow halos indicate a fungal or bacterial disease caused by overwatering. Isolate the plant, withhold water until soil dries out and treat with fungicide. Remove severely damaged leaves. Pest What to Look For How to Treat Mealybugs Small, white, oval insects measuring 1/4 inch and powdery wax on plant stems Spray with water, insecticidal soap, or neem oil Fungus gnats Small flies, eggs and larvae in plant soil Keep soil very dry and water with equal parts hydrogen peroxide and water Aphids Small, pear-shaped insect that is green, yellow, red, or black Spray with water, insecticidal soap, or neem oil Common Problems With ZZ Plant Leggy Growth A ZZ plant's stems will grow thin and leggy when it's not getting enough light. Place your plant in a spot where it will receive two hours of indirect light at minimum to avoid leggy growth. The plant is known to tolerate nearly full shady conditions without natural light, but you won't get too much growth that way. The more light you give it, the more growth you'll get. Yellow Leaves Overwatering ZZ plant leads to problems including yellowing leaves. Older leaves fade and drop naturally but if newer foliage loses its shiny green color it's time to cut back on watering. Let the plant dry out completely and, if necessary, repot into fresh dry, potting mix. FAQ Where is a good spot in the house for a ZZ plant? For optimum growth from your ZZ plant, make sure to place it away from any drafty areas or cold vents. An ideal location is where there is indirect light. Is it okay to touch a ZZ plant? Yes, you can touch a ZZ plant but you might want to wear gloves when dividing, pruning, or repotting because its sap can cause skin irritation in sensitive individuals.1 Wash with soap and water to remove sap from skin. What is the lifespan of a ZZ plant? ZZ plants have long lifespans and can live up to decades (20 to 30 years) with the proper care. What is so special about a ZZ plant? A ZZ plant is special because of its low care requirements and beautiful structural shape. It's a plant that anyone can take of (no matter how inexperienced with plants) and works great as a piece of decor. Do ZZ plants like deep or shallow pots? When choosing a pot for a ZZ plant, it doesn't matter too much how deep or shallow it is. However, make sure the pot is wide enough and has good drainage so it doesn't become root bound or waterlogged."

    "content": "About ZZ Plant Centuries old, the beloved tropical ZZ Plant, also known as Zanzibar Gem, grows wild in the dry soils of East Africa, making this curious evergreen hard to kill. ZZ Plant grows slowly and steadily, reaching up to three feet tall. It thrives under almost any condition, and is thus a favorite in every plant collection - especially for the brown thumbs and forgetful among us. Other common names Aroid Palm Emerald Palm Eternity Plant Zanzibar Gem Zuzu Plant How Often Should I Water My ZZ Plant? With easyplant, watering your ZZ Plant is simple. Make sure to check the easyplant reservoir once every two months and fill it when empty, and you're all set! ZZ Plant Light Needs ZZ Plant grows best in a well lit space with medium to bright light and can adapt to low light or spaces without natural light as well. ZZ Plant Plant Care ZZ Plant is very tolerant and hard to kill, making it an easy-care plant that will quickly bounce back from any mishap. To help it grow optimally and evenly, occasionally dust the leaves and rotate the pot by a ¼ turn once a month. How Big Do ZZ Plant Plants Grow? ZZ Plant grows slowly and steadily, reaching between one to three feet tall. Provided with enough light and sufficient soil, ZZ plants will sprout a number of new stems each spring and summer before reaching maturity in 3-5 years. During fall and winter, or other low-light conditions, ZZ plants enter a hibernation phase and effectively cease growth. Temperature & Humidity Like most plants, the ZZ plant is best acclimated to temperatures between 60 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Due to their tropical origins, they also prefer humidity levels in the neighborhood of 50%. In short, they thrive in ordinary room temperature conditions. However, it’s worth noting very high levels of humidity can prevent growth, while the very low levels of an arid climate can cause leaf crisping. Are ZZ Plant Toxic for Pets & Kids? ZZ plants may be mildly toxic if ingested, so be sure to keep away from curious children and pets. ZZ plants are full of calcium oxalate in the form of tiny crystals with jagged edges. Exposure is generally a very minor risk that will not cause lasting damage. On the skin, they can cause minor rash symptoms, while in the eyes they can produce burning and redness similar to shampoo. Ingesting them may cause mild discomfort or vomiting. Troubleshooting Common Problems with ZZ Plant If you notice a stem becoming weak or droopy, cut to remove the entire stem and relocate the pot to a more brightly lit area. If you notice stems getting too long, prune them down to your preferred shape and relocate the pot to a less brightly lit area. If you notice the leaves begin to curl, relocate the pot to a less brightly lit location. Frequently Asked Questions about ZZ Plant Plant What are the benefits of a ZZ plant? Close What are the benefits of a ZZ plant? In a list of zz plant benefits, there are essentially two primary attributes to consider. First and foremost, this sort of leafy evergreen provides dynamic sprouts which look healthy and rich year-round. That makes them great for adding a lively touch to many types of smaller- to medium-sized spaces. Of almost equal importance, these plants are great at improving indoor air quality. They even remove small amounts of household cleaning agents from the air. How long can a ZZ plant live? Close How long can a ZZ plant live? The ZZ plant is not an annual or semi-annual plant, it’s an evergreen shrub that can have a surprisingly long lifespan. It only takes three to five years for the ZZ plant to move from sprout to maturity. Yet, with appropriate care, a ZZ plant can live for decades. As a houseplant, the most common cause of death for a ZZ plant isn’t neglect, but overwatering. Is a ZZ plant easy to care for? Close Is a ZZ plant easy to care for? How do I care for a ZZ plant? In many cases, the answer is as simple as remembering it’s there. Because the ZZ plant is drought tolerant, is not particularly picky about soil, and handles many kinds of lighting conditions gracefully. Though doing so can accelerate growth, it also doesn’t require regular fertilizing. Owing to its ability to thrive in most ordinary room conditions, it’s fair to say that it’s easy to care for a ZZ plant."

Easy to grow, harvest, and use, chamomile looks lovely planted among veggies in the garden, tucked into raised beds filled with herbs, or added to a pretty container on your patio or balcony. Not only does chamomile add beauty and sweet fragrance to the garden, but it's also a terrific companion plant, beckoning beneficial insects (think pollinators) to visit your garden. Companion planting gurus swear that chamomile helps repel some pests with its fragrance, too. In other words, the benefits of chamomile go way beyond tea. In fact, ancient Greeks, Egyptians, and Romans sang the praises of chamomile, using it as an herbal remedy for ailments ranging from inflammation to insomnia. Most popularly, though, dried, crushed chamomile flowers and leaves have, for many years, been used to brew tea that aids sleep, relieves anxiety, and calms stomach upsets. So, why wait? Make this your year to grow chamomile! Just follow this guide. Quick Guide to Growing Chamomile Purchase Bonnie Plants chamomile from your favorite retailer. You can find a retailer in your area here. Wait until after the last spring frost to add chamomile to your garden. It grows well in raised beds, containers, and in-ground gardens. Space chamomile plants 8 inches apart in full sun for best flowering. In hot climates, an area with partial afternoon shade is ideal. Mix compost or other organic matter into the soil when planting. Water immediately after planting, then give plants 1 inch of water per week until well-established. Mix a continuous-release fertilizer into the soil at planting time and replenish as directed during the growing season. Spread mulch (such as chopped leaves or straw) around the plants to help keep the soil moist. Add a support, like bamboo sticks with twine around the plant, if the chamomile gets top-heavy and floppy. Harvest flowers with pruning sheets after blooming, when petals begin bending backwards. Use chamomile fresh or dry. Dry flowers and leaves completely on a screen, out of direct sunlight. Store dried chamomile in an airtight jar in a dark, dry place, like a pantry. Soil, Planting, and Care Chamomile, as you might guess from its pretty white flowers with yellow centers, is a member of the daisy family (Asteraceae). When you look for chamomile, you'll find two types: Roman, which is a low-growing perennial used primarily as a ground cover; and common chamomile (aka German chamomile), the more upright annual that's most popular in teas and herb gardens. While the flowers and leaves of both varieties are edible, Roman chamomile tends to taste bitter, which is why we recommend growing sweet-tasting common chamomile. With its hint of apple flavor, it's a tasty edible flower for teas and culinary use. Choose chamomile from Bonnie Plants. With more than 100 years of experience producing healthy, strong plants for home gardeners, you can be sure your plant is vigorous and ready for its new home in your garden. (Did you know that we grow in more than 70 greenhouses throughout the country? That means our plants don't have to travel far to reach your local retail location, so they experience less transport stress.) Chamomile blooms best in a location with full sun, but it will grow in partial shade, too. In fact, in hot Southern climates, chamomile benefits from a bit of afternoon shade, which will help keep the blooms from drooping. Before planting chamomile, prepare your garden bed by adding compost or other organic material to the soil, especially if your soil is primarily clay or sand. Chamomile prefers rich soil with a pH ranging from 5.6 to 7.5. To give your chamomile a great start, add aged compost-enriched Miracle-Gro® Performance Organics™ All-Purpose In-Ground Soil to your garden bed. Organic matter like this helps the soil retain moisture while also improving drainage, which is especially important with clay soil. Chamomile grows beautifully in raised beds and containers, too, but each requires a different, lighter soil. When planting in pots, fill them with a light, premium potting mix like Miracle-Gro® Performance Organics™ All Purpose Container Mix, which contains nutrient-rich compost. For raised beds, use Miracle-Gro® Performance Organics™ Raised Bed Mix, which provides excellent drainage and important nutrients to promote strong root development and plant growth. Once you've improved the soil, it's time to plant! Dig a hole large enough to accommodate the plant's root ball. Remove the chamomile plant from its pot, gently loosening the roots. Place the plant in the hole with the top of the root ball level with the surrounding soil. Fill in the rest of the hole with more soil, pressing firmly but gently around the base of the plant. Water thoroughly to settle the plant and remove air pockets in the soil. Chamomile's shallow roots benefit from a layer of mulch around the plant's base to help prevent weeds and retain soil moisture. If adding several chamomile plants, space them about 8 to 12 inches apart for good air circulation. Chamomile needs about an inch of water per week when young. Once established, it's fairly drought tolerant—let it dry out between waterings, but make sure to water during extremely dry periods. The best way to know if you need to water the chamomile is to stick your index finger into the soil about an inch down near the base of the plant. If it's moist—no need to water. If it's dry, time to give it a drink! Because chamomile stems, which grow about 2 feet high, can get floppy in poor, nutrient-deprived soil, make sure to feed your plant regularly. In garden beds, use a continuous-release fertilizer like Miracle-Gro® Performance Organics® Edibles Plant Nutrition Granules beginning a month after planting and continuing throughout the growing season (see label directions). Simply pull back the mulch, scatter the fertilizer around the base of the plant, and replace the mulch before watering well. For a convenient way to feed container-grown chamomile, use a water-soluble fertilizer like Miracle-Gro® Performance Organics® Edibles Plant Nutrition every week or two throughout the growing season. Troubleshooting Chamomile grows easily—in fact, the annual version self-seeds so prolifically that in some areas, it may be considered a pest. (Check with your area's Extension Service if you have any questions.) If you find your bed becomes overrun with chamomile seedlings, simply pull them out or snip the seedlings to ground-level. Or, if you have space, plant your chamomile in a sunny area and let it spread—your friends and neighbors will be happy to share in your bounty! Chamomile can get a little top heavy as the season goes on, so a support—like a peony ring or bamboo stakes with twine—can help keep it upright and looking lovely. Powdery mildew can appear during long periods of hot, damp weather. Space plants so they enjoy good airflow to help deter the disease. At first signs of it, remove diseased leaves and discard them (don't compost them!). Generally, few pests bother chamomile. If aphids become a problem, spray them off the plant with water or treat it with insecticidal soap if there's a serious infestation. Make sure to plant chamomile after the danger of frost passes in spring. To extend your harvest time in fall, a hoop house or row cover should give your plants some protection from early cold spells. Harvest and Storage Harvesting chamomile is simple, as it's considered a \"cut-and-come-again\" herb. Harvest flowers after they fully open, when the petals begin arching backwards toward the underside of the bloom. Snip the flowers with pruning shears, catching them in a bowl for an easy harvest. Leaves can be harvested anytime, but never take more than 1/3 of the plant. The plant will continue to bloom all season long until frost, giving you 3 or 4 good-sized harvests. When temperatures begin to fall and frost is in the forecast, it's time for a final harvest. Cut the remaining flowers and leaves and bring them inside. Place the flowers and leaves on a screen or parchment paper in a cool space out of direct sun, allowing them to dry thoroughly, which usually takes about two weeks. Cover with a lightweight, breathable cloth (like cheesecloth) to keep dust away. Stir the flowers and leaves occasionally to make sure they dry completely. You'll know your harvest is dry and ready to store when the flowers easily crumble when crushed. Dried chamomile keeps beautifully in glass mason jars. Add the date to the lid of the jar for future reference, and store the jar in a cool, dark place, like a pantry or cupboard. How to Use Chamomile While chamomile is most famous for its use in tea to help ease stress, relieve stomach upset, and to boost the immune system, it's also an excellent addition to baths. Add a cup of fresh or dried flowers for a soothing, aromatic soak that can help relieve itchy and inflamed skin conditions like eczema, sunburns, and rashes. Chamomile is also used as a hair rinse, not only to improve shine but also to help relieve dandruff. Fresh chamomile flowers also make a lovely addition to culinary creations, adding sweetness to salads and acting as a pretty, fresh decoration for cakes. A few stems of chamomile also look lovely in homegrown bouquets! Flowers can be used fresh or dried to make chamomile tea—but double the amount of chamomile if using fresh flowers. Chamomile tea is gentle enough to make into popsicles to soothe a child's sore throat, too. (If your child has any allergies, consult your doctor first. Also, chamomile is not recommended for pregnant or nursing women.) How to make chamomile tea: Use 1 tbsp. dried chamomile flowers per 8 oz. cup of water Place crushed chamomile flowers in a tea infuser Pour boiling water over the flowers Steep for 5 minutes Remove the infuser Add ice for chamomile iced tea Enjoy!"

    "content": "There are two similar plants that go by the common name chamomile. Roman chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile) is a low-growing, fragrant perennial plant that produces daisy-like white flowers from early summer through fall. German chamomile (Matricaria recutita) is a taller, annual version of chamomile, reaching up to 2 feet tall. It has white flowers but with showy yellow centers. Both plants mix well with herbs in a traditional herb garden or try growing them alongside perennials in a mixed border. Chamomile Overview Genus Name Chamaemelum nobile, Matricaria recutita Common Name Chamomile Plant Type Annual, Herb, Perennial Light Part Sun, Sun Height 3 to 24 inches Width 10 to 12 inches Flower Color White Season Features Spring Bloom, Summer Bloom Special Features Attracts Birds, Fragrance, Good for Containers, Low Maintenance Zones 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Propagation Division, Seed Problem Solvers Deer Resistant, Drought Tolerant, Groundcover, Slope/Erosion Control Where to Plant Chamomile A location with full sun is best. The soil should be well-drained with a slightly acidic to neutral pH. The low-growing Roman chamomile makes a fragrant perennial groundcover. Plant it in a rock garden where it will soften hard edges and slowly spread to cover large swaths of soil. Grow chamomile along a flagstone walkway because it will creep between the stones, blanket the soil, and prevent weeds. It can even be used as an aromatic grass substitute for lawns. It tolerates minimal foot traffic, though, so plant it in areas that are primarily viewed. Annual German chamomile is a good companion plant for any members of the cabbage family as well as herbs in the mint family, which also includes rosemary, lavender, sage, rosemary, thyme, oregano, and basil. How and When to Plant Chamomile For potted nursery plants, dig a hole about twice the diameter of the pot and about the same depth. Place the plant in the hole and fill in original soil to the top of the root ball. Gently tamp down the soil and water it well. Keep it until the plant is established. Space Roman chamomile 8 inches apart and German chamomile 12 inches apart. Chamomile Care Tips Chamomile is an easy-to-grow plant that requires little care. Light The plant does best in full sun but also tolerates light shade. Soil and Water Chamomile does best in well-drained, sandy soil. The ideal pH is in the range of 5.6 to 7.5. Once established, chamomile is fairly drought tolerant but does better if watered during dry spells. Temperature and Humidity Both German and Roman chamomile prefer cool summer climates. Roman chamomile is winter-hardy even in subzero climates. The plants can tolerate some heat but not extremely hot weather and no extreme humidity. Fertilizer Chamomile usually does not require fertilizer; ir can even grow in poor soil. Overfertilizing can backfire and lead to leggy plants with few flowers. Pruning When chamomile become spindly or leggy and flowers are sparse, prune the plant back to about 4 to 5 inches, which will encourage new, more compact and bushy growth and more flowers. Potting and Repotting Chamomile All chamomile varieties make good container plants. Select a pot with large drainage holes and fill it with well-draining potting mix. Remember that container plants require more frequent watering and fertilization than plants in the landscape. As an annual, German chamomile is discarded at the end of the season but Roman chamomile needs to be repotted every few years into a larger pot when it has outgrown its container. Despite Roman chamomile being winter-hardy in cold climates, containers exposes the plant’s roots to the cold, which can damage or kill the plant. Leave the container outdoors year-round but winterize the pot by sinking it into the ground or by placing in it in a second, larger pot to create a planting silo. Pests and Problems With the exception of aphids, chamomile is not bothered by any pests or diseases Aphids can be washed off with a garden hose. How to Propagate Chamomile Roman chamomile is best propagated by division in the spring just as the new growth starts. Dig up the clump and lift it out of the ground, then cut it into smaller sections. Make sure each section has intact roots. If you are propagating it from a large mat, you can also cut of a section of the plant with its roots. Replant the sections at the same level as the original plant and water them well until established. German chamomile is started from seed and in most areas is best started indoors 6 to 8 weeks before the last average frost date. Place the seeds in 4-inch pots filled with damp potting mix. Do not cover them as they need light to germinate. Keep them at a temperature between 60 to 75 degrees and evenly moist. Once the seedlings emerge, they will need ample sun; place them in a bright, south- or west-facing window or under grow lights and transplant them outdoors after the last danger of frost. Harvesting In spring and summer, gather leaves to use fresh or to dry for later use. Pick fully open, fresh flowers early in the day. Rinse under running water and pat dry. To dry the flowers, spread them on a rack or screen and place in a dry, warm spot but out of direct sunlight. Leave them until fully dried, about 2 weeks. Store dried flowers in airtight jars in a dark location. Note that due to its side effects, chamomile should only be consumed in limited amounts and with caution. It should not be consumed by people with asthma and pregnant women.1 Types of Chamomile German Chamomile Matricaria recutita is an annual bearing daisy-shape white flowers all summer. It grows 2 feet tall. This is the chamomile widely grown for tea. It has a sweet, straw-like taste with herbal and grassy notes. Roman Chamomile Chamaemelum nobile is a potentially evergreen groundcover that grows 3 to 6 to inches tall and spreads 12 inches. Each feathery stem grows one daisy-like flower that is larger than 1 inch in diameter. Zone 4-8 Chamaemelum nobile ‘Treneague’ This cultivar of Roman chamomile is a dwarf non-flowering variety that can be planted instead of lawn. If forms a 2- to 4-inch tall, fast-growing mat of fern-like fragrant leaves that stays evergreen in areas with mild winters. It does not require clipping. Zone 4-9 Frequently Asked Questions Is chamomile invasive? Chamomile spreads over time via creeping stems that root as they move across the soil. German chamomile also freely self-seeds. If you provide chamomile with optimum growing conditions, it can grow aggressively. However, it is not to be confused with scentless chamomile ((Tripleurospermum inodorum​), also known as false chamomile, an annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial that has been reported as invasive in parts of the United States. How do you make chamomile tea from the flowers? To brew a soothing tea, pour hot (not boiling) water over fresh or dried blooms; steep, strain, and add honey and lemon. Aim for a ratio of 1 cup of hot water to 2 to 3 teaspoons of flowers. Brew tea from leaves in a similar fashion."

    "content": "Mint, the sprightly herb that graces gardens and kitchens alike, holds a unique place in both culinary arts and home décor. Its vivacious green leaves and invigorating aroma are not just the secret ingredients to your favorite mojito but a symbol of freshness that transcends culinary boundaries. Yet, as wonderfully versatile as mint is, it requires attentive care to truly flourish. Understanding the do's and don'ts of growing mint can be the key that unlocks its fullest potential, offering rewards that reach far beyond the garden. This article aims to be your guiding light in the art of mint cultivation, presenting the ultimate guide to mint plant care right in the comfort of your home. Understanding the Mint Varieties Mint is a multifaceted herb, available in diverse flavors and fragrances. From the bold notes of peppermint to the subtler taste of spearmint and the intriguing chocolate mint, the world of mint offers endless possibilities. Other variants like apple, pineapple, and orange mint contribute to this rich tapestry, each bringing a unique twist. These diverse flavors are not merely for enjoyment; they serve various culinary purposes. While peppermint may enhance your hot tea or chocolate dessert, spearmint might be your go-to for savory dishes and salads. Chocolate mint can inspire a world of creative desserts and cocktails. Choosing the right mint isn't merely about preference. It's a careful alignment with your culinary goals and garden needs. Whether you're aiming for an aromatic landscape or crafting beverages, there's a mint variety tailored to your aspirations. The Do’s of Mint Growing Lighting Mint thrives in a spot that receives partial shade to full sun. If you have a spot that enjoys the morning sun but is shaded in the intense afternoon heat, that's your mint's paradise. But fret not, for mint is forgiving and can adapt to full sun if needed. Soil A well-drained soil rich in organic matter is mint's best friend. A pH level ranging from slightly acidic to neutral (6.0 to 7.0) makes an ideal home for mint. If your soil doesn't naturally meet these conditions, amendments with compost or other organic materials can create the perfect environment. Temperature and Climate Mint prefers moderate climates and can even withstand a frost. However, in regions with extreme cold or heat, container gardening might be the better path, allowing you to control the conditions more precisely. Container vs. Ground Planting Mint, with its natural inclination to spread, can become a garden bully if not properly contained. While ground planting is an option, it requires caution. Container planting is often the preferred method, providing control over the growth and spread of mint. By confining mint to a pot, you can enjoy its beauty and aroma without worrying about it overtaking other plants. If you decide to plant mint in the ground, be prepared to enforce boundaries, or you might find it growing in unexpected places. Spreading Prevention If ground planting is your chosen path, don't fret; you can still have your mint without the chaos. Implementing barriers is a brilliant strategy. Barriers such as bottomless containers, specialized garden edging, or even deep trenches can effectively limit mint's wandering tendencies. Seed, Cutting, and Transplanting Seeds are an option but can be a bit unpredictable when it comes to mint. They might not always grow true to the parent plant, especially with hybrid varieties. Cuttings, on the other hand, are an efficient way to ensure that the new plant carries all the characteristics of the parent. Simply snip a healthy stem from an established plant, place it in water until roots develop, and then transplant it into soil. Transplanting established mint plants is also an option and can be an excellent way to share mint with friends or move it to a new location in your garden. Watering When it comes to watering, mint thrives on consistency. It enjoys moist soil but despises waterlogged roots. In general, watering mint two to three times a week is sufficient, depending on the climate. Allow the soil to dry slightly between waterings to avoid root rot, but never let it dry out completely. A well-draining potting mix helps maintain this delicate balance. Fertilizer Fertilizing mint, on the other hand, is a task that requires finesse. Mint's flavor can actually diminish with excessive nutrients. A light application of an organic all-purpose fertilizer in the spring can jump-start your plant's growth. Consider options like fish emulsion or well-composted manure, as they release nutrients slowly and align with natural growth patterns. Pruning Pruning mint is all about encouraging lush growth. Regularly pinching off the tips stimulates more branching, leading to a fuller appearance. Fresh leaves can be enjoyed, while removing dead or diseased ones improves air circulation. Quick and attentive pruning not only shapes the plant but also keeps it healthy, preventing potential problems. Harvesting Harvesting mint is crucial for optimal flavor, best done in the morning when essential oils peak. Wait until the spring is three to four inches tall before cutting them one-third of the way down. Cut stems one-third of the way down, avoiding taking too much foliage at once, as this can harm the plant. A careful approach maintains the plant's integrity and ensures vibrant flavors. The Don’ts of Mint Growing Overwatering If you notice yellowing leaves, a lack of vigor in the plant, or even the appearance of mold or fungus at the soil surface, these might be alarm bells signaling that you are drowning your precious mint. Mint plants do prefer a moist environment, but overwatering can lead to root rot and a decrease in the essential oils that give mint its signature aroma and flavor. Avoid this mistake by implementing a well-balanced watering schedule. Feel the soil; it should be slightly dry to the touch between waterings. Using a container with proper drainage holes and a soil mix designed for herbs can further prevent this issue. Ignoring Pests Ignoring pests can be detrimental to your mint garden. While mint is known for its resilience, it isn't entirely resistant to aphids, spider mites, whiteflies, and diseases like powdery mildew or rust. The key to protecting your mint lies in vigilant monitoring and natural remedies. Regular inspection of both the tops and undersides of leaves can help you spot early signs of trouble. If you discover an infestation, organic insecticidal soaps or neem oil sprays can be effective solutions without the need for harsh chemicals. Embracing eco-friendly strategies such as encouraging natural predators like ladybugs can keep your garden in balance. The correct routine, encompassing proper watering, pruning, and spacing, can often prevent pest problems before they even start. Neglecting Propagation Neglecting propagation is a typical yet critical mistake in mint cultivation. Proper methods like cuttings, division, or seeds ensure robust growth, but errors can stifle the process. Avoid taking cuttings from flowering plants, as this can hinder success. When dividing, handle roots gently to prevent damage, a common misstep leading to failure. Seed propagation requires precise temperature and moisture, and neglecting these factors can slow germination. Beyond the Basics Companion Planting with Mint Companion planting is an age-old gardening technique that harnesses the natural synergies between plants, and mint is an exceptional companion in the garden. By placing mint near suitable partners like tomatoes, cabbage, and peas, you create a symbiotic relationship that enhances growth and flavor. Mint's strong aroma is known to deter common pests such as aphids and cabbage moths, offering a natural line of defense for neighboring plants. Mint in Culinary Creations Fresh mint brings an unparalleled zest to various dishes. Whether it's adding a sprig to a refreshing mojito, incorporating it into a vibrant salad, or using it as a garnish for a sumptuous dessert, mint's versatility knows no bounds. But what about when you have an abundance of mint? Preservation methods such as freezing mint leaves with a touch of water in ice cube trays or drying them in a cool, dark place can ensure that the tantalizing taste of mint can be enjoyed year-round. Medicinal and Aesthetic Uses From a health perspective, mint has been acclaimed for its soothing effects on the digestive system and its ability to alleviate headaches and stress. Its cooling sensation can bring immediate relief when applied topically to the skin, a quality celebrated in various beauty routines. Moreover, the vibrant green leaves and invigorating scent make mint a delightful addition to home décor. Whether displayed in elegant vases or incorporated into homemade candles and potpourri, mint infuses spaces with freshness and vitality. Frequently Asked Questions How can I prevent mint from spreading all over the garden? To keep mint from taking over your garden, plant it in containers or use underground barriers to contain the roots. Regular pruning of the stems also helps control growth, maintaining the plant's shape and vitality without allowing it to invade other areas. Can I grow mint indoors? Absolutely! Mint thrives indoors with proper lighting and care. Place it near a sunny window or use grow lights, and ensure well-drained soil. Is mint safe for pets? Mint is generally safe for pets, but individual reactions may vary. Always consult with a veterinarian for specific considerations related to your animal. Why is my mint wilting? Wilting can result from underwatering, overwatering, or pest infestation. Assess your plant's specific needs and make adjustments, such as consistent watering or pest control methods. Can I plant different mint varieties together? It's not advisable, as different mint varieties may cross-pollinate, leading to loss of distinct flavors. Planting them separately or using barriers can maintain their unique characteristics."

    "content": "Here's how to grow mint indoors so you have easy access to this fragrant herb all year round. Growing mint indoors means you'll have the key ingredient for serving up mojitos, mint juleps, and decadent mint desserts. Mint is one of the easiest and most popular perennial herbs to grow in the garden, but it's also easy to grow indoors. All it takes is a well-lit spot and a little know-how. Whether you want to extend your growing season or simply don't have the space to garden outdoors, these tips teaching you how to grow mint indoors will help you create a thriving indoor garden of mint plants. 1. Buy Transplants Instead of Seeds Using transplants from a garden center will ensure that you start growing mint indoors with an authentic plant that will produce up to your expectations. Mint is unreliable when grown from seed because different varieties often cross-pollinate and leave you with plants that might not have the desired characteristics. Be sure to choose varieties of mint that you may never see at your local grocery store, such as apple mint, chocolate mint, and orange mint. After all, growing unique varieties is one of the benefits of growing your own mint plants. 2. Select a Suitable Container Once you get your new mint plants home, repot them into a container at least 8 inches deep and one or two sizes larger than the original container. Most herbs do best when planted in pots at least 12 inches across to allow room for root growth. Mint also grows well in hanging planters. Keep in mind that a plant in a porous clay pot needs water more often than one in a plastic or ceramic pot because it will dry out faster. Make sure the container you choose for growing mint indoors has holes in the bottom to allow water to drain out. If you already have a mint plant growing outdoors in your garden, you can bring it indoors and repot it to extend the growing season. Be sure to relocate your mint indoors before the temperature drops below 40℉ to protect it from cold damage. 3. Use Fresh Potting Mix Purchase a potting soil mix designed for edible plants—one that allows for good drainage and contains only a small amount of fertilizer, if any. You can also mix your own potting soil from equal parts bagged and sterile compost, perlite, and coarse sand. The mix needs to offer both air space and enough water retention to keep roots healthy. Starting with a fresh, sterile mix when growing mint indoors will help prevent diseases, pests, and weeds from popping up. 4. Keep Mint Consistently Watered Water your mint plant when the top of its container’s soil feels dry, or about once a week. If there is extra water in the saucers under your pots, empty it out to prevent excessive sogginess in the soil, which can cause root rot. Soil that stays too wet can also encourage insect issues such as fungus gnats. On the flipside, mint can tolerate short dry spells, bouncing back quickly if it wilts. But if the plant dries out too much, the edges of the leaves will turn brown and crispy. 5. Provide Plenty of Light A kitchen windowsill with a southern exposure is usually a good spot for growing mint indoors because it's convenient to reach while cooking and likely to have enough light and air circulation. Rotate the pot about a quarter turn weekly so that all sides of the plant receive four to six hours of bright sunlight. If there's not enough sunlight inside your home, place your mint plant under grow lights for 12 to 14 hours each day. 6. Increase Air Circulation If you see fungal diseases on your mint plant, such as powdery mildew, that's a sign that the humidity around your plant is too high. Use a small fan when growing mint indoors to keep moist air moving gently around the plants to minimize certain diseases and insect problems that thrive in high humidity. 7. Avoid Temperature Extremes For the best indoor growing conditions, keep your home's temperatures between 65℉ and 75℉. Avoid growing mint indoors on windowsills with inconsistent temperatures, such as near heating vents or cooking appliances. 8. Harvest Mint Leaves Just Before Bloom When the plant is at least 3 inches tall, you can begin pinching off mint leaves to use in your favorite recipes for a little minty kick. The flavor is most intense right before the plant blooms. Pinch off any blooms right before they open so the plant will make new buds. Frequently Asked Questions Can I grow mint indoors from cuttings taken from an outside plant? Yes, you can take cuttings from a healthy outdoor mint plant to grow indoors. Just take 3- to 4-inch cuttings of stems, strip off lower leaves, and stick stems into moist potting mix. Cover your newly planted cuttings with a clear plastic bag to help conserve moisture. Can I grow mint cuttings in water? Rooting your mint cuttings in water is as easy as rooting a plant in soil. Just place the stem's cut end into a cup of water and change the water every few days. Just know that you can’t grow mint in water forever, so when you see roots appear, plant your mint stems in some potting mix. Keep the soil moist, and soon you’ll see more stems and leaves sprouting. Can I make essential oils from homegrown mint? Yes, you can use a distillation method to extract your own essential oil. You can also create infused oils two ways: muddle and cover, where you blend the mint with oil and let it sit for a few days; or in a blender, where it is mixed with oil and then refrigerated and strained. All oils should be stored in clean, food-grade, dark-colored bottles and refrigerated for longevity. Do you pick mint leaves from the top or bottom? You should pick the leaves from the top of the plant, since this is where you will find the newest, freshest growth. Simply go down the stem until you reach the next set of leaves. Then cut above the next set. What is the typical lifespan of a mint plant? These plants can last 5 years under the right conditions. However, they can last even longer if you replant them every few years. Meanwhile, their leaves will last about 10 days in the fridge."

Sold Out Detail Goth Garden Bundle Sale price$134.00$134.00Regular price $158.00$158.00 How Do You Take Care of Rubber Plants in the Winter? Rubber plants enter their dormant period as the winter approaches, thus requiring less attention and effort compared to the summer season. Place your Ficus elastica in a spot with bright indirect light; as the winter sun is lower, you may have to adjust its location in your home. Hold back on watering your rubber plant too frequently in the colder months. The best practice is to water every 1-2 weeks or when the topsoil feels dry. Additionally, use lukewarm ‘overnight’ water to hydrate your plant. Winters are generally less humid, so place your rubber plant on a pebble tray to make it comfortable. Wipe the foliage with a damp cloth to clean it and maintain hydration and the leaves’ glossiness. If your plant has been kept outside in the summer, bring it back indoors when the temperatures drop below 50°F to prevent stress and cold damage. Stop fertilizing your rubber plant in the winter, as it doesn’t need feeding during the cold months. When Should I Bring My Rubber Plant Inside? Bring your rubber plant inside when temperatures drop below 50°F (10°C). These plants prefer a stable indoor environment and can suffer from cold temperatures. Moving them indoors before the first frost ensures they stay healthy and thrive during the cooler months.

Hot weather may affect them adversely if extra care is not provided. Ideally, they thrive in temperatures ranging from 60°F to 75°F (15°C to 24°C). Q: How cold can Ficus elastica tolerate? A: Ficus elastica can tolerate temperatures as low as 50°F for a few days. They are too sensitive to the cold, so it’s best to bring your plant indoors when the temperature is around 60°F to avoid damage to your green companion. Q: Can a rubber plant survive winter? A: Rubber plants don't go fully dormant in winter, but their growth typically slows down, due to lower light levels and cooler temperatures. During this period, they require less water and should be kept from cold drafts. Ensuring they receive adequate indirect light can help them maintain their health through the winter months. Conclusion Understanding and providing the right light conditions is essential for a thriving rubber plant. These plants flourish in bright, indirect light and should be protected from direct sunlight to avoid leaf damage. Some companion plants with similar light requirements that you can grow with your Ficus elastica are Snake Plants, the popular ZZ Plant, and everyone’s favorite Golden Pothos. These low-maintenance plants also thrive in indirect light, making them perfect buddies for your rubber plant. With proper care and the right lighting, your indoor garden will flourish beautifully."

As with most houseplants, how dry or wet the soil is can let you know if your plant needs a drink. Dip your finger about three inches into the soil. If your finger comes out mostly clean and dry, it’s time for a drink. If it’s moist with lots of soil sticking to it, check back in a couple days. Check more often during the spring and summer to keep your rubber plant hydrated when it’s hot. Make sure you water evenly and thoroughly to reach every root. Drain your plant before putting it back in the decorative pot to avoid letting water sit at the bottom, as this can cause root rot. If your rubber plant’s leaves are turning yellow, brown, or even falling off, this could be a sign of overwatering. How much light and humidity does my rubber plant need? Their leaves can hold a lot of moisture, so normal room humidity is just fine for Rob, Robin and Melika. As a rule of thumb, it’s best to keep rubber plants in bright rooms, at least a few feet away from windows that get direct sunlight, where the humidity and temperature feels comfortable for you. Large rubber plant in a white plastic pot, in the kitchen Repotting rubber plants Rubber plants are fast growers, so make sure you check during the springtime if their roots are poking out of the nursery pot. If they are, it’s time to repot. This is so their roots have enough space to spread out, absorb nutrients and grow. Learn more about repotting here. Show your rubber plant some extra love During spring and summer, you can give rubber plants extra attention by treating them to liquid fertiliser once a month. Dilute this with an equal measure of water since rubber plants aren’t big feeders. Rubber plants also like their leaves to be moist and clean, so wipe the leaves with a cloth to keep dust away and spritz with water every few days."

Jason Ingram Wiping a rubber plant leaf. Jason Ingram Watering Over-watering is common with rubber plants. Only rehydrate the compost once the top third has dried out, or when the pot feels light when lifted. While the pot feels heavy, this means the soil is still moist and therefore won't need to be resaturated. Water the soil thoroughly until you see it drip from the drainage holes below. Water the plant slightly less often in autumn and winter, but still with the same amount of water so it drips out of the drainage holes each time you irrigate."

    "content": "How to grow a rubber plant Ficus elastica, widely known as the rubber plant, is a magical and practical giant in the wild, but as a houseplant it is a foliage stalwart. Hazel Sillver looks at how to grow this very reliable fig By Hazel Sillver 6 February 2025 Save this story Image may contain Plant Potted Plant Leaf Jar Planter Pottery Vase Flower and Tree Ficus elastica starts at £9.95 at Hortology Information Rubber plant Common names: rubber plant, rubber fig, Indian rubber tree Botanical name: Ficus elastica Family: fig (Moraceae) Type: evergreen houseplant Flowers: no Height: 60cm to 2.5m (2 to 8ft) Spread: 30cm to 1m (1 to 4ft) Aspect: bright indirect light Temperature: 13 to 25°C (55 to 77°F) Hardiness: H1B Difficulty: easy One of the most popular houseplants, being easy to look after and hard to kill, the rubber plant (Ficus elastica) has been grown in our homes since the Victorians fell in love with it. Its large oval evergreen leaves are dark, leathery, and glossy, with bronze-tinted undersides, and its stipules have a rosy-purple hue. There are several cultivars on the market, with ivory, pink, or copper colouring. As an indoor pot plant, F. elastica rarely exceeds 2 metres and could easily be mistaken for a relatively uninteresting but reliable mass of foliage. However, in its preferred habitat, this ubiquitous houseplant is a very different beast. Found in tropical forest, it can grow into a wondrous – and sometimes enormous – specimen: a sculptural tree that soars to 40-metres tall or more, with a vast, spreading canopy and a wide 'trunk', formed of both its trunk proper and its roots. When young, the banyan-like aerial roots of F. elastica dangle from the tree or wrap around it and, when older, they become more solid and form multiple smaller 'trunks' or buttresses around the main trunk. The roots' relative flexibility and capacity to become straight and strong once mature means they make a fascinating building material. In the damp, hot forests of northeast India (where F. elastica is a native tree), the roots are trained to form living root bridges over rivers and gorges. This is primarily in the mountainous forested state of Meghalaya, which is the wettest place on Earth; during the rainy season, when the region's umpteen waterways can be impassable, these incredible bridges allow locals to move around easily. WATCH Inside a tiny Cotswold cottage embraced by nature And the plant boasts a further practical use: the milky-white latex it contains can be used to make rubber . . . hence its common name, rubber plant. However, F. elastica is not employed as much for rubber production as it was in the past. Today, it is the Amazonian Hevea brasiliensis (the Pará rubber tree) that is grown commercially to produce 99% of the world's rubber, in the enormous rubber plantations of South Asia. F. elastica is also a bit of a wild man, capable of growing on or out of riverside rocks and cliffs and in the middle of boulder-strewn rivers. In the right conditions, it grows quickly, in a wide variety of forest terrain and withstands monsoon storms well. Advertisement So, never let it be said that the good old rubber plant in the corner of the room is a bit dull. Rather, it is one of the wonders of the plant world, as well as a trusty houseplant. Where to put a rubber plant Ficus enjoy lots of bright indirect light, such as an east or west-facing window, although they are relatively tolerant of semi-shade. Sit them well away from cold draughts and radiators because they dislike too much fluctuation in temperature at 13 to 25°C (55 to 77°F). Enjoying humidity, rubber plants grow well in a kitchen or bathroom. Image may contain Furniture Table Chair Dining Table Indoors Interior Design Desk Architecture and Building Beazy on Unsplash How to grow a rubber plant Humidity In a room with low humidity, sit the plant on a tray of pebbles and water or mist the leaves regularly. Watering Water when the surface of the compost feels dry; water considerably less during winter. Never leave the plant sitting in water for long periods. Feeding Feed once a month, in spring and summer, with a nitrogen-rich fertiliser. Light If varieties with colour in their leaves (such as 'Ruby') lose their fabulous colouring, move them to a brighter position because they will colour better with more light. But avoid scorching south-facing windowsills, as direct sun can damage the leaves. Dust Wipe the leaves with a damp cloth regularly to remove dirt and show off their natural gloss. Movement Ficus hate being moved and may drop a few leaves in protest until they become used to their new site. Replenish Remove the top layer of compost each spring and replace with a fresh layer of peat-free potting compost. Repot every 2 to 4 years. Shaping To create a bushier plant, prune the tops of the growing stems. Safety The plant contains a white latex, which can irritate skin and eyes, so wear gloves if you cut the plant back. Which rubber plants to grow There are several varieties of Ficus elastica available, including tough guy 'Robusta' (large rich-green leaves), pretty 'Belize' (pink-tinted leaves), variegated 'Tineke' (green and ivory leaves), and stylish 'Abidjan' (luscious dark leaves with a bronze tint). Similar houseplants to grow The fiddle-leaf fig (Ficus lyrata) and weeping fig (Ficus benjamina) are closely related to the rubber plant (Ficus lyrata) and enjoy the same position and care. The African fiddle-leaf has huge violin-shaped leaves that are dark green, textured, and leathery; it can grow to 2.5 metres or more as a houseplant, but there is a compact 1-metre form called 'Bambino'. Pinch out plant's growing tips to encourage it to branch (rather than growing as a single stem). The weeping fig (from Asia and Australia) grows into a gorgeous small house tree with plumes of arching leaves and the variegated forms light up a room. Ficus pests and diseases Mealybugs, scale insects, and red spider mites can affect the plants, especially in a conservatory."

Best Soil Type: Chinese money plants prefer a well-draining soil, and can do well in succulent or cactus potting soils for extra drainage. pilea Credit: The Spruce / Krystal Slagle Chinese money plant Chinese Money Plant Care Although this popular houseplant may be difficult to get your hands on, once you have one it is surprisingly easy to care for. Place Chinese money plant in a spot where it will get a lot of bright, indirect light. Prepare moist but well-draining soil. Water thoroughly once the soil has dried out. Maintain room temperature and average humidity. Rotate the plant occasionally so that it does not become lopsided. Fertilize lightly in spring and summer. Dropping Leaves It's normal for plants to drop one or two older leaves as they put their energy into new growth. However, if you start to notice lots of your Chinese money plant's leaves dropping, it's most commonly a sign of overwatering and root rot. Be sure to address this immediately to prevent any more leaves from dropping. Light Provide medium-to-bright, indirect light for your Chinese money plant. An east- or west-facing window may be ideal. Rotate your plant regularly to keep it looking symmetrical. Avoid locations that receive harsh, direct light as it will burn the delicate leaves. While this plant can adapt to lower light conditions; it will become leggy, grow fewer offshoots, and the coin-shaped leaves may become smaller. Overall, this plant is the healthiest and most attractive when grown in bright light conditions. Soil Plant Chinese money plant in rich, well-draining soil, and amend the soil with perlite to increase drainage and ensure the soil does not become waterlogged. A high-quality organic potting mix that is peat-based or coir-based is best. A soil pH between 6.0-7.0 is ideal for this plant. Water Chinese money plant is considered to have medium water needs. Allow the plant to nearly dry out between waterings and then water well. The leaves will begin to droop when it dries out, which is a good indication that it’s time for watering. Watering Tip Want to be sure your Chinese money plant is getting the water it needs? Our favorite moisture meters take the guesswork out of watering your houseplants. Temperature and Humidity The average household temperature and humidity are fine for this plant. Where possible, avoid overly dry conditions, which usually means keeping the plant away from heating vents or baseboards. The Chinese money plant is hardy to freezing temperatures, but when kept indoors avoid exposing it to temperatures below 50°F. However, a short period of cold exposure in the winter months may help to encourage blooming. Fertilizer Chinese money plant benefits from monthly fertilization in the spring and summer months. Use a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer for best results. Follow product label instructions. Avoid fertilizing during the fall and winter months when the plant has gone into dormancy. Get What Your Chinese Money Plant Needs A plant mister can help keep your plant healthy if your home is dry. If you don't have a bright enough spot for your Chinese money plant, a grow light can help it thrive all year long. Houseplants benefit from a good fertilizer once a year, preferably in fall to help it stay healthy through winter. Potting and Repotting Chinese Money Plant With the right care, a Chinese money plant grows fast. Before long, it can fill its pot with roots and baby plants. If you see roots coming out of the drainage hole, it’s time to repot. The best time to do this is in early spring or summer. When picking a new pot, choose one that’s just a little bigger—about one or two inches wider than the old one. Make sure it has a drainage hole at the bottom. That helps extra water flow out so the roots don’t rot. You can use a plastic, ceramic, or terra-cotta pot. Just remember: if you go with terra-cotta, you might need to water your plant more often. That’s because terra-cotta soaks up water from the soil. Get Your Repotting Gear The 9 Best Garden Trowels The 6 Best Soils for Indoor Plants 9 Must-Have Self-Watering Planters Propagating Chinese Money Plant Chinese money plants are super easy to grow more of because they make baby plants, called offshoots, all on their own. When one of these offshoots is a few inches tall, you can safely separate it from the main plant. You can grow the new plant in water or soil, but it does best in bright light and with a bit of humidity. Here’s how to plant an offshoot in soil: Find a small offshoot and gently push the soil away from its base. Use clean pruners to carefully cut the offshoot away from the main plant. Plant the offshoot right away in a small pot with moist soil. Keep the soil damp (not soggy) while it grows new roots. Once it’s growing on its own, care for it like a regular plant.

Keep an eye out for mealybugs, scale, fungus gnats, and spider mites, and treat accordingly if you notice an infestation. Pest to Watch Pilea peperomioides are very prone to spider mites, which spin webs underneath the leaves and will suck nutrients from the leaves, resulting in browning edges on the leaves or visible spots. If you turn a leaf over and notice webbing or tiny insects crawling about, you likely have spider mites, which can be treated with rubbing alcohol, insecticidal soap, or neem oil. How to Get Chinese Money Plant to Bloom Mature Chinese money plants sometimes bloom with very tiny flowers on stalks that emerge from the base of the plant. Should you want your Chinese money plant to bloom, try moving it to a colder room for the winter months. This slight shock to the system sometimes causes a plant to send forth flowers as a means of propagating itself. Common Problems With Chinese Money Plant Chinese money plant is typically a fast-growing, easy-to-grow plant that is ideal for growers who don't have the time or interest in babying temperamental houseplants. Problems can be traced to deficits in light exposure or an irregular watering routine and manifest in the leaves. Yellowing Leaves Yellowing leaves that eventually fall off indicate the plant is getting too much water. Use a moisture meter to confirm that the soil is dry before watering. Curling Leaves When the leaves of a Chinese money plant curl up along the edges, it can be because the plant is not getting enough bright indirect light, because room temperatures are too high, or because the room humidity is too dry. Watering too much or too little can also cause this problem. Browning Leaves It's quite common for the leaves on a Chinese money plant to signal their displeasure over environmental problems by showing discoloration. Browning leaves may result if your plant is getting too much direct sunlight. Remember that this plant likes bright indirect light. Browning Leaf Tips Yellow or brown edges on leaves are often a sign that the room humidity is too low. Leaves may also fall off. FAQ What are the benefits of Chinese money plants? In feng shui, Chinese money plants symbolize luck, prosperity, and friendship. They also have air-purifying qualities. Where should I put a Chinese money plant in my house? These plants do well in medium to bright indirect light, which often translates to a west- or east-facing window. However, the leaves can burn if placed in direct sunlight. Do Chinese money plants need full sun? Chinese money plants need plenty of full, indirect sunlight every day, but shouldn't be placed in direct sunlight. A Chinese money plant that gets too much sun will respond by getting brown burn marks on its leaves. Should I mist my Chinese money plant? It's not necessary to mist your Chinese money plant to keep it healthy, but they can benefit from the occasional misting. If your home is especially dry, misting can help prevent crisping leaves or drooping."

It’s playful, very pleasing to the eye, and fairly easy to care for. Pilea plants grows like crazy and then grows little babies so you can share it with friends! Each time I look at mine, I can’t help but smile. Their quirky form is like no other plant. Table of Contents: Potting Pilea Plants How Much Water Do Pilea Plants Need? How Much Sunlight Do Pilea Plants Need? Propagating Fertilizing a clear chair with a green and pink blanket on it with a stand next to the chair and a plant on the top and bottom shelf close up of the plant's leaves Pilea plants, or Chinese money plants, slowly spread through people sharing its “pups,” and within the last several years, it has made its way here to the States. I love learning/reading the history about this plant. You can literally track it back to its exact location and the person who brought it and shared it. Besides being an aesthetically pleasing plant, it’s also very easy to care for, and it’s quite hardy! Here are some tips for caring for the pilea: Emma holding a potted plant Potting Pilea Plants I find that repotting a pilea can really encourage growth—giving it some wiggle room will encourage the pups to spread out. To help prevent root rot, use a pot with a drainage hole. If you have a pot that you love and it doesn’t have a hole, these drill bits are great for drilling a hole on the bottom of an earthenware pot. I love the trusty terracotta pot since they are utilitarian and simple. The terracotta is excellent because it is a natural clay and will let the soil breathe a bit (unlike a plastic pot). Don’t get me wrong, you can use a plastic pot or a heavily glazed pot that has a drainage hole, but if you accidentally overwater your pilea, the terracotta will be more forgiving since it dries out a bit faster. If you have a decorative pot that you love, simply stick your terracotta pot inside your decorative one. I will take the terracotta pot out of the decorative one for waterings, let it drain completely, and then stick it back in the decorative pot. clear chair with green and pink blanket on it next to a stand with a plant on the top and bottom shelf To repot your pilea, pour some small stones on the bottom about 1-inch deep. The rocks aid with drainage and will help your plant not succumb to root rot. For soil, I use a quality, well draining potting mix. Your local greenhouse should have this, or you can pick some up at your local hardware store. My mix has a bit of fine sand in it. We have some pretty humid months where I live (in southern Missouri), so the sand helps dry the plant out a bit faster. clear chair with blanket and pink pillow on it next to a window with a plant on the window sill How Much Water Do Pilea Plants Need? You have to water your pilea moderately, but do not overwater it. They like to dry out in-between waterings and they don’t like to stay soggy. I stick my finger in the dirt and lift the pot to see if it still feels heavy from the last watering. If it feels dry to the touch, then I water it again. Let it dry out between waterings but be sure that it doesn’t get bone dry (although it is quite hardy and can handle it). I water mine once a week. If I check the plant and it still feels moist, I’ll wait a couple more days and check again. The other day, a friend texted me a picture of her pilea which was drooping quite a bit. We came to the conclusion that it needed to be watered. It had dried out a bit too long! The plant will tell you what it needs and when it needs it, so just keep a watchful eye. I asked a local greenhouse about the pilea and watering and they said one of the only ways to kill it is by overwatering. When you water your pilea, never let it sit in water. Once you’ve watered it, make sure that you empty the excess water that catches in your bottom dish. If the dirt stays wet/soggy for too long, then the roots actually rot, which can likely lead to the death of the plant. I am prone to overwatering, and it has taken me a good bit to rein in my need to “nurture” (aka overwater) the plant. How Much Sunlight Do Pilea Plants Need? The pilea loves the light! Bright indirect sunlight is what it needs. What does that mean? If you put your pilea on your front porch with the sun beaming down on it, then that would be direct light and it will burn. 3 potted plants on a white table with books and decor next to them Keep them indoors near a bright window (which is indirect light). I put mine in the brightest window in my house and they love it. My mom had a pilea on her dining room table (it was low light) and it started getting long and leggy—a very long middle stem with just a few branches. It was trying to reach for the light and looked like it wouldn’t make it much longer. She put it outside under her covered porch where it gets lot of indirect light and it is thriving again. It is no longer long and leggy! It is amazing how they adapt once you figure out what they need. I have run out of window space in the house and I’ve put some of my pileas outside under a covered porch. They seem to love the summer air and are growing beautifully! As soon as the temperature starts to drop, I will bring them back in. Another tip about lighting is that the pilea will follow the light and start leaning towards it. It’s kind of funny to see them reaching for the window like they are trying to break free! I rotate mine each watering and that helps to keep them straight and balanced. Keeping the leaves dusted helps them get more light as well. Use a damp cloth and lightly rub off any dust to keep the leaves healthy and shiny. potted plant on a windowsill Propagating One of the best parts of a pilea plant is how fast it reproduces baby plants! As it matures, little babies will pop out of the soil or grow from the stem (near the dirt). These babies are called “pups.” The pups actually grow from the root system and pop out of the dirt on top. When the pups start growing, you can either cut them off of the mother plant or let them grow. Letting them grow creates a full mother plant (which is beautiful)! leaves from a plant It’s crazy how fast and full they’ll grow when you don’t make any cuttings. I also have a pilea that’s specifically for “sharing” that I will propagate and give to friends. I like to wait until the pup is at least three inches tall before I cut it. My favorite tool to use is an X-Acto knife, but any sharp utensil will work. Give your cutting utensil a good rinse before cutting into your pilea. I once heard that you should think of pruning or propagating your plant like real surgery and always wash your tools beforehand. When you are ready to cut off a pup, be aware that the root system is very delicate. There is no need to tug or pull on the pup. Gently cut the pup where it meets the dirt and it should come right up. Once you have cut it off, you can either stick the pup in water or pot it in dirt. I prefer the water method because I like to see the roots growing through the glass. For best results, stick your little glass or vase in indirect but bright sunlight. Once you see some roots growing, you can pot it. leaves from a plant in a vase of water Fertilizing If you want to give your pilea an extra boost of growth, you can fertilize in the spring and summer months. There is some debate on fertilizer, but I like to use a simple 10-10-10 formula. I prefer a liquid fertilizer because it spreads evenly through the plant. When I water, I pour a little liquid fertilizer into the watering can. Make sure you check the back of your fertilizer and follow the label instructions."

With its signature circular leaves and charming presence, it’s no wonder this Insta-famous plant has become a household favourite. But to keep your green friend looking its absolute best, a little TLC goes a long way. Here are our top Chinese Money Plant care tips to help your leafy pal flourish. Light – Let There Be (Indirect) Sunshine When it comes to Chinese Money Plant care, getting the light just right is absolutely essential. The Chinese Money Plant thrives in bright, indirect sunlight—it loves soaking up gentle light but doesn’t appreciate harsh, direct rays that can scorch those iconic, coin-shaped leaves. The best spot? Near a large, bright window in a kitchen, bathroom, or living room where it can bask in filtered sunlight all day long. Just be sure to shield it from intense midday sun, especially in the summer months, to keep those glossy leaves looking their absolute best. If you’ve noticed your Pilea plant not growing as it should or getting leggy and stretched out, low light is often the culprit. When starved of light, your Pilea will reach desperately for the sun, becoming lanky and less lush. To avoid this, rotate your plant regularly to encourage even growth, and keep those round leaves dust-free to maximise light absorption—after all, clean leaves are happy leaves! Styling tip: place your Pilea Peperomioides in one of our beautiful ceramic pots—choose from soft almond stoneware or elegant grey ceramic—for a botanical look that’s as pretty as it is practical. Want to create a lush urban jungle? Pair your Pilea with a few larger houseplants for depth and texture that’ll wow your family and friends. Is Chinese money plant toxic to pets? If you share your home with curious cats or dogs, rejoice—Pilea Peperomioides are pet-friendly! This makes it a perfect choice for pet owners looking for pet-safe plants. Don’t forget to explore our collection of other fabulous pet-friendly plants that will complement your Chinese Money Plant perfectly, creating a green, happy home for all. Water – The Goldilocks Approach How often should I water my Pilea? When it comes to the Pilea plant watering schedule, consistency is key. Generally, once a week is just right – but always check first. Use your finger to test the top inch of soil. If it feels dry, it’s time for a drink. If it’s still damp, wait a few more days. The Chinese Money Plant doesn’t like soggy soil, and overwatering can be a common cause of problems. Spotted Chinese Money Plant yellow leaves? Don’t panic – it’s usually a sign of overwatering. Gently remove the yellowing leaves near the base to encourage healthy growth, and allow the soil to dry out a little before watering again. A few yellow leaves here and there are perfectly normal as the plant sheds old foliage. Top tip: If your Pilea is feeling a bit limp and light when picked up, it’s likely time for a good soak. Water thoroughly and allow excess moisture to drain away—just make sure your plant isn’t sitting in water, as this can lead to dreaded root rot. Soil – Happy Roots, Happy Plant Choosing the best soil for Chinese Money Plant care is also key. A well-draining indoor plant mix like the Plantsmith Peat-Free Houseplant Compost will work wonders, as it offers the perfect balance of coconut coir (a by-product of the coconut industry) mixed with slow release Plantsmith nutrients, helping prevent soggy roots and supporting healthy growth.

Repotting your Pilea Peperomioides We also get a lot of questions from you guys about repotting. In general, don’t repot your Pilea until Spring/Summer, when the light levels are better, and the plant is in its growing phase. Pileas quite like a good amount of room so will happily be repotted into a slightly larger growing pot within 9-12 months, if you are seeing good growth. Giving the roots that little bit more room will encourage good growth and bigger coin-shaped leaves. If you want to keep the same, look and feel, once potted, pop the larger growing pot in one of our larger Little Botanical ceramics. Check out our larger pots under accessories. If you’re still having a few problems with your Chinese Money Plant or are a newbie plant owner and you want to make absolutely sure you’re doing it right, feel free to drop us a message. We love to hear from you, and we’re more than happy to help and answer any questions. Pilea Peperomioides Propagation – How to Grow Your Plant Family One of the absolute joys of owning a Pilea Peperomioides, aka the Friendship Plant, is how effortlessly it propagates. True to its nickname, this charming houseplant loves producing plenty of adorable baby Pileas—perfect for sharing with friends or growing your own indoor jungle! As your Chinese Money Plant matures, you’ll start spotting these mini Pileas popping up at the base, each with their signature round leaves. You have two lovely options: keep the babies attached to create a fuller, bushier plant, or carefully snip them off to raise your very own new Pilea plants. For the best results when propagating your Pilea, use a clean, sharp knife to cut the baby Pilea’s stem about 3cm down into the soil. Then, gently pot it in fresh, well-draining, moist houseplant soil. With plenty of bright, indirect light and a little care, you’ll soon have a thriving new Pilea baby to enjoy—or gift! If you prefer, you can also propagate your Pilea Peperomioides in water. Simply place the baby plant in a jar of clean water and wait for roots to start growing. Once you see those delicate roots, it’s time to transfer your new plant into soil. Keep in mind that rooting directly in soil tends to be faster, but whichever method you choose, make sure to keep an eye on your little Pilea—young plants can dry out quickly in small pots. A green side table with books and houseplants, including a Chinese Money Plant, ZZ Plant and Devil's Ivy A pug dog on a bench looking at the camera, behind him on a table are three houseplants - a Chinese Money Plant, Devil's Ivy and a Boston Fern A Pilea Peperomioides (Chinese Money Plant) on a small round side table Fun facts about the Chinese Money Plant This plant is also known as the ‘Missionary Plant’ because a Swedish missionary brought it to Europe from China in 1946. We’re very grateful for this, otherwise, we might not be able to enjoy this gorgeous plant today. The large, flat, circular leaves look slightly like pancakes, which is where the Pancake Plant nickname comes from. While we find this very interesting, we’d definitely advise against eating the leaves. They won’t taste as good as they look! Why we simply love this Pilea plant You might have picked up on the fact that we’re really fond of this plant. It’s no secret! We love it most because of the leaf shape, and with its many clever nicknames, what’s not to love about it? And, it doesn’t take up much room, but it doesn’t need to. Those gorgeous green round leaves will add interest and style to your home in any bright room. Moreover, it can help to purify the air around you too. So, whether you like its best-known name or you prefer to call it UFO Plant (see if you can guess where this name comes from!), this little green gem, is a truly delightful houseplant for everyone to enjoy. Pilea Peperomioides From £19 This must have house plant, more commonly known as the Chinese Money Plant, is top of every indoor jungle creator's wish list."

Philodendron Brasil has distinct splashes of lime-green variegation on the otherwise classic green leaves. This tropical plant likes bright, indirect light, well-draining soil, and moderate humidity. Like most Philodendron, this plant is toxic to people and pets.12 Common Name Philodendron Brasil Botanical Name Philodendron hederaceum ‘Brasil’ Family Araceae Plant Type Perennial, vine Mature Size 4-6 ft. tall, 1-6 ft. wide Sun Exposure Partial, shade Soil Type Moist but well-drained Soil pH Acidic, neutral Hardiness Zones 10-12 (USDA) Native Area Central America, Caribbean Toxicity Toxic to people, pets21 Philodendron Brasil Care Here are the main requirements for growing philodendron Brasil: Provide it with bright, indirect light for best variegation results. Plant it in well-draining, slightly acidic soil. Water regularly but do not overwater or leave in soggy soil. Fertilize it monthly during the growing season in the spring and summer. Prune to remove dead foliage and to control its size. Philodendron brasil plant with dark and light green variegated leaves closeup Credit: The Spruce / Anastasiia Tretiak Philodendron Brasil plant with variegated leaves and new growth on stem closeup Philodendron Brasil plant with green and yellow variegated leaves overhead Light Philodendron Brasil is able to survive in a range of lighting conditions but will show its variegation best in bright, indirect light. In low-light conditions, the plant will get leggy and lose its variegation. Soil The plant survives in a standard indoor potting mix, however, it will thrive in slightly acid soil that is specifically designed for philodendron and other aroids (members of the Araceae family). Either buy commercially produced philodendron potting mix or make your own by mixing equal amounts of worm castings, perlite, peat moss or coco coir, and orchid bark. Water Allow the top 2 to 3 inches of soil to dry out between waterings and then water well. Philodendron Brasil is sensitive to overwatering and should never be left in soggy soil for extended periods. Temperature and Humidity Native to the tropical rainforests of South America, philodendron Brasil grows best in warm, humid conditions. The plant does well indoors in typical household temperature and humidity levels, although providing it with extra humidity will encourage larger and more vigorous growth. These philodendrons are not cold tolerant and should never be left in temperatures below 55°F to 60°F. Fertilizer During the growing season in the spring and summer, the plant benefits from a monthly application of a complete balanced liquid houseplant fertilizer. Stop fertilizing altogether in the fall and winter as the plant enters dormancy. Pruning Under the right conditions, philodendron Brasil is a fast grower that may require light pruning to keep its size manageable. Pruning also helps to encourage fuller growth and larger leaves. Pruning should be done in the spring or early summer while the plant is actively growing. Using a pair of clean, sharp scissors or pruning shears prune any stems that are particularly long or unruly or grow only small leaves. Set the stem cuttings aside to use for propagation. Is This the Right Plant for You? PHILODENDRON BRASIL IS A GOOD CHOICE FOR YOU IF: You don't have pets—or you have a good place to keep plants away from your pets You want an easy-to-grow houseplant You want a houseplant that grows well from cuttings Propagating Philodendron Brasil As with many plants in the philodendron genus, philodendron Brasil is easily propagated from stem cuttings. Propagating philodendron is a great way to start new plants or create a fuller plant by rooting the cuttings and then planting them back in the original pot. Here is how it’s done: Take 4- to 5-inch stem cuttings using a pair of sharp scissors or pruning shears. Ensure that each cutting has at least four to six leaves on the stem. Remove the bottom two to three leaves from each stem cutting to expose the nodes along the stem, leaving two to three leaves on each cutting. Place the cuttings in water, ensuring that the exposed nodes are submerged while the leaves remain above the water. Put the cuttings in a location with bright, indirect light. Within two to four weeks, you should begin to see small white roots sprouting from the nodes below the water. Once the roots have reached 1 inch in length, the cuttings are ready to be transplanted into pots. Plant the newly rooted cuttings in a container filled with damp, well-draining potting mix. Return them to the same location where they have been growing for the past several weeks. For the first two to three weeks after planting, keep the soil regularly moist (but not soggy) to help the newly sprouted roots adjust to the potting mix. Potting and Repotting Philodendron Brasil This is a fast-growing plant that will need to be repotted every year or two. Like other Philodendron, it does not like to be root-bound. Repot in the spring or summer when it is growing, which reduces plant stress. You will know it's time to repot the plant when you see roots poking out of the pot's drainage holes. Only go up one pot size, make sure the container has sufficient drainage holes, and fill it with fresh potting mix. Common Pests While philodendron Brasil is not susceptible to any particular pests or diseases, keep an eye out for common houseplant pests such as mealybugs, scale, spider mites, and fungus gnats. Regularly inspecting your plants for pests and proactive treatment is the key to preventing infestations. Common Problems With Philodendron Brasil Philodendron Brasil is low-maintenance and problem-free when grown under the right conditions. However, you may notice some of these common problems if something is off with your watering schedule or lighting conditions. Curling Leaves Curling leaves are an indication that your plant is not receiving enough water. Ensure that you are watering once the top couple inches of soil have dried out and avoid letting your plant sit in fully dry soil for too long. Browning Tips Browning leaf tips can have different causes; usually it’s a result of your philodendron being exposed to overly dry conditions. Ensure that you don’t have an air vent blowing directly on the leaves and consider providing your plant with extra humidity using a pebble tray or humidifier. Another culprit is too much direct sunlight; the browned leaves are simply burnt. Browning leaves can also be caused by a lack of water. Ensure that you don’t let the plant dry out too much between waterings. Loss of Variegation Loss of variegation is due to a lack of light. In low light conditions, the philodendron Brasil will begin to revert to a standard heartleaf philodendron. Ensure that you move your plant to a brighter location, and cut off the pieces of the plant that have reverted in order to promote new variegated growth. FAQ Does philodendron Brasil like to climb? This vine-type philodendron likes to climb so provide it with a moss pole or a trellis. Whichever type of support you choose, it should have a rough surface for the plant to grab onto. Should I cut off damaged philodendron leaves? Once the leaves of your philodendron Brasil are damaged (yellowed, browning tips, or physical damage, like a tear), unfortunately, there is no way to reverse the damage; these leaves can be removed from the plant. Regularly removing dead or damaged leaves helps your plant focus its energy on its healthy leaves and new growth. Why is my philodendron Brasil dripping water from its leaves? Water droplets hanging from the leaves is how the plant relieves water pressure.3 It may be an indication that your plant has more water than it needs to stay healthy and a great early warning sign that you should cut back slightly on your watering because you don’t want your plant to suffer from root rot. Does philodendron Brasil have flowers? Philodendron Brasil is primarily grown for its brilliant foliage and although it may flower, the blooms are rather insignificant and rare when grown indoors. However, if you notice a green and white spathe growing from your plant, congratulations—your Brasil has bloomed."

I’m sharing tips for Philodendron Brasil care, including watering, pruning, propagation, repotting, and more. Learn how to keep your Philodendron Brasil healthy and thriving for years! I have my Philodendron Brasil growing in a hanging planter, and at one point, the trails had gotten so long they were touching the floor; it was such a sight to see. Five years later, I pruned it back to a more manageable length because it was getting weak and leggy. It’s been pruned, repotted, and is coming back beautifully. What attracted me to the Brasil variety is its variegated foliage; the markings set its look apart from my other houseplants. Brasil has beautiful yellow/green patterning in the middle of the heart-shaped leaves that are edged in a rich green. The care of this plant is quite simple, which makes it an ideal choice for beginner gardeners. Here’s a plant that should be added to your list of “must-buy houseplants.” Botanic name: Philodendron hederaceum “brasil” Common name: Philodendron Brasil, Philodendron Brazil Table of Contents Philodendron Brasil Traits How To Use Philodendron Brasil Growth Rate Size How to Care for Philodendron Brasil Philodendron Brasil Light Philodendron Brasil Watering Temperature Philodendron Brasil Care FAQs View more Philodendron Brasil Traits Close up of the variegated leaved on a philodendron brasil growing indoors. Here’s a close-up of the variegated leaves. This is one of the Heartleaf Philodendrons named after the colors of the Brazilian flag. How To Use Philodendron Brasil The Philodendron Brasil is a tabletop or, more commonly, a hanging plant. It can be trained to grow up a trellis, a moss pole, a piece of bark, or over a bamboo hoop. Growth Rate If you’re looking for a fast-growing plant, you’ve found one. Mine grows over 2′ each year. In lower light conditions, it’ll be slower growing. Size You can find them in 4″, 6″, and 8″ grow pots. The most common size I’ve seen sold is 6″, usually in a hanging pot. The longest the trails got on mine was 7′ before I pruned them off the floor. How to Care for Philodendron Brasil Philodendron brasil monstera minima & sweetheart hoya houseplants sit on a floating shelf. My Brasil on the floating shelf in my former home next to its Monstera minima & Sweetheart Hoya buddies. Over three years have passed since this photo was taken. My, these three plants are so much bigger now! Philodendron Brasil Light Like many houseplants, the Philodendron Brasil does best in bright, natural light. This would be moderate or medium light levels. Mine now hangs in the kitchen, 5′ away from a south-facing window. We get ample sunshine all year in here in Tucson, so my Brasil is very happy growing in the indirect sunlight. Near an east, south, or west exposure is fine. Keep it out of hot, sunny windows and avoid direct afternoon sun; otherwise, your Brasil will burn. If the light levels are too low, your Brasil will grow slower. In addition, the plant will gradually lose the chartreuse variegation, and the foliage will become smaller. It’ll look like a Heartleaf Philodendron (Philodendron hederaceum) with solid green foliage. In the darker winter months, you might have to move yours to a location with more light. Here’s a guide on Winter Houseplant Care, which will help you. Philodendron Brasil Watering I keep mine slightly moist. This is a bit of a vague term, but I let it go almost but not completely dry. It gets watered every 6-7 days in the summer, and in winter, about every 14 days. Don’t water it too often or let it sit in excess water because it’ll eventually succumb to root rot. Sticking your finger in the soil or using a monitor is the best way to tell if it needs water. If the soil feels dry down towards the bottom of the pot, then give it some water. Planting in a pot with a drainage hole(s) will also help avoid root rot. Your Philodendron Brasil may need to be watered more or less frequently than mine, depending on the pot size, the type of soil it’s planted in, the location where it’s growing, and your home’s environment. My guide to Watering Indoor Plants will shed some light on this subject. A hanging philodendron silver stripe houseplant sits on a hanging shelf. This is my Philodendron Silver Stripe, another Heartleaf Philodendron cultivar. The foliage isn’t quite as vibrant, but it’s a gorgeous plant with long trails. Temperature Average home temps are fine. If your home is comfortable for you, it’ll be so for your indoor plants, too. Be sure to keep your Philodendron Brasil away from cold drafts and air conditioning or heating vents. Humidity Philodendrons are tropical plants native to high humidity regions with warm temperatures. Despite this, they do just fine in our homes which tend to have dry air. Here in hot, dry Tucson, my Brasil grows beautifully and only has a few dry leaf tips. I have a humidity meter in my dining room. I run my humidifiers when the humidity reads low, often in the Arizona desert! If you think your Brasil looks stressed due to lack of humidity, fill the saucer that sits under it with pebbles and water. Put the plant on the pebble tray, but make sure the drain holes and/or the bottom of the pot aren’t submerged in any water. Misting a couple of times a week will help. Monstera minima satin pothos arrowhead vine & agalonema siam houseplants sit on a blue patio table. Here are some other popular plants in the Araceae family. In the front are Monstera minima & Satin Pothos with an Arrowhead Plant & Aglaonema Siam in the back. Fertilizing/Feeding Spring and summer are the best times to fertilize your plants. Early fall is fine, too, if you’re in a temperate climate. We have a long growing season here in Tucson from mid-February through October. I fertilize with Maxsea or Sea Grow, Grow Big, and Liquid Kelp seven times during the growing season. It’s how I feed all my tropical plants. I alternate using these granular and liquid fertilizers and don’t mix them. Houseplants appreciate the nutrients these plant foods provide. Two to five times a year, depending on your growing zone, might do it for your plant. Whatever you use, don’t fertilize houseplants in late fall or winter because it’s not their active growing season. Don’t over-fertilize (use too much or do it too often) your plant because salts build up and can burn the plant’s roots. This will show up as brown spots and brown tips on the leaves. You want to avoid fertilizing any stressed houseplant, i.e., bone dry or soaking wet. This is How I Feed Indoor Plants, including all my Philodendrons. Nell Foster stands outside on her back patio holding a philodendron brasil. My Brasil had gotten long & straggly. It needed a new pot & fresh soil. I gave it a severe haircut, which you can see in the “Pruning Video” below. I propagated the stems, repotted the plant, & planted the rooted stems along with it. This is how it looks right after. It’s been a few months since, & the plant is putting out quite a bit of new growth. Repotting Repotting a Philodendron Brasil is best done in spring and summer. Into early fall is fine if you’re in a climate with warm winters like me. Mine was growing in a 6″ pot. I recently repotted it into an 8″ pot. You can see the process in the Repotting Guide video below. I’ve done a general Guide To Repotting Plants geared for beginning gardeners, which you’ll find helpful. Philodendron Brasil Soil Generally speaking, Philodendrons like well-draining soil with a rich, somewhat chunky soil mix with a good dose of peat. You don’t want the roots to stay consistently wet; otherwise, they’ll rot out. I used roughly 1/2 potting soil, 1/4 coco chips/coir, and 1/4 pumice. Coco coir is a more sustainable alternative to peat moss and has the same properties. I’ll threw in a few handfuls of compost for richness. Use a potting soil that is peat-based and formulated for indoor plants. I alternate between Happy Frog and Ocean Forest, and sometimes I combine them. Both have lots of good stuff in them. I topped it all with a 1/4″ layer of worm compost (for extra richness). Note: I have many plants (indoors and outdoors) and do a lot of planting and repotting, so I have a variety of materials on hand at all times. Plus, I have plenty of room in my garage to store all the bags and pails. If you have limited space, I’m giving you a few alternative mixes suitable for a Philodendron Brasil repotting listed below, consisting of only two materials. Alternative mixes: 1/2 potting soil, 1/2 coco fiber or peat moss 1/2 potting soil, 1/2 orchid bark, or coco chips 3/4 potting soil, 1/4 pumice or perlite Training The stems of this Philodendron grow long. I let mine trail, but some twine up the macrame hangers on their own. I included this section because you might want to train your plant to grow upwards if you don’t want it to trail. Moss poles are a standard support method, but you can also use a smaller-sized trellis, piece of wood, or bamboo hoops. Here’s how I Trained My Hoya and made the DIY Trellis for my Swiss Cheese Vine. Pruning After five years, my Philodendron brasil was looking leggy and unattractive. It grew in a 6″ pot in a basket on a hanging shelf, and the 7′ trailing stems had sparse sections. It was time for a big haircut and to repot it into a larger pot with fresh soil. The “Pruning Video” below shows the big cutback I did a few months ago. Fresh variegated leaves are appearing; the plant is filling back in and looking good. Pruning will help maintain a plant’s shape and encourage new growth. Plus, you can propagate the pruned stems and start new plants. Always a great incentive to prune! Whether you tip prune or do more extensive pruning is up to you. Close up of the nodes on the stem of a philodendron brasil. You can see the nodes here. They are what the roots emerge from them. They make propagating easy & fast! How To Propagate Philodendron Brasil I’ve never divided a Heartleaf Philodendron, mainly because they’re so easy to grow from stem cuttings. The brasil is a snap to propagate. You’ll see nodes on the stems. In nature, those are the aerial roots anchoring their stems to other plants as they climb and grow. To propagate by stem cuttings, prune a stem right below a leaf node and aerial root (make sure your pruners are clean & sharp). The cuttings can be put in water or a light mix to root. By the way, you should see roots appearing in about two weeks. I prefer to root in water because I can easily see the progress. Keep the bottom node or two covered with water. Change the water every 7-10 days to keep it fresh. I propagated my Philodendron Brasil via stem cuttings in water – you can get a more detailed step-by-step in this post. Pests My brasil hasn’t gotten any pests (so far, anyway!). They can be susceptible to mealybugs, scale, and spider mites, so keep your eyes open for those. Pests live inside where the leaf hits the stem and underneath the leaves, so check these areas occasionally. It’s best to take action as soon as you see any pests because they multiply like crazy. They can travel from houseplant to houseplant fast, so make sure to get them under control pronto. For most pest infestations, you can control them with neem oil or insecticidal soap. Pet Safety The Philodendron Brasil, like other plants in the Araceae family, is considered toxic to pets. I always check out the ASPCA website for my info on this subject and see in what way the plant is toxic.

    "content": "Philodendron Brasil Care Guide Brasil baby! Wow what a looker. With every leaf unique, it's hard to stick to owning only one Philodendron Brasil. Also called a variegated heartleaf Philodendron. Oh, and if you see it spelt Brazil (with a 'z'), not Brasil (with an 's'), it's not a different plant. Brasil is the 'correct' spelling, but really, who cares when you have these leaves to look at every day. Lucky you. Before we jump in, if you have the OG green Heartleaf Philodendron, and she's happy and healthy, get a Brasil with confidence. Same care required (maybe with a smidge more light). We give the handsome Brasil a 2 out of 5 LTLC Rating (border-line 1.5 for being so easy care, with a few considerations). Check out the full guide below... close up of a philodendron brasil leaf care guide ltl nz Light, temperature & humidity Some Philodendron tolerate low light (although they still prefer medium to bright light), but with his extra variegated leaves, you'll want to give this dude brighter light to boost that variegation and feed that growth for bigger, more variegated leaves. Bright, indirect light is the way to go, even a little sunlight for short time, provided it's not a scorching time of year (we'd go for early morning light in summer, or winter sunlight - no hot afternoon summer sun!). If you're not sure what the sun's going to do, or how long he'll be in direct sun in the spot you're thinking of for your Brasil, then go for somewhere with no direct sun instead. Play it safe. Don't risk burning those precious leaves! Near a sunny window with sheer curtains to protect from direct light would work too, but he'll also be fine in medium light. The Brasil like it on the warmer side, but will handle down to about 13 degrees at night or in winter, a bit cooler if all other conditions are good. His happy range is about 16 to 24 degrees. This chap's definitely a humidity fan. At least 40% humidity is a good minimum. He'll be okay with typical NZ humidity, but if it's extra dry (maybe you have an HRV or DVS, or air con / heat pump running), then consider regular misting, a pebble tray, or ideally a humidifier. The fave humidifier for our own collection is the Crane humidifier (we got ours from Mighty Ape). These smooth leaves benefit from a good shower or heavier mist every so often to stop dust build-up blocking light from being absorbed. Soil We like a mix of about 2/3rd's potting mix, and 1/3rd something free draining mixed in - our go to is perlite. We've heard sphagnum peat moss, a peat vermiculite or peat and perlite mix all work well too. You want a mix that retains water but still lets the excess drain out pretty fast so you avoid a soggy bottom. Philodendron brasil variegated leaves care guide ltl nz Water Let this chap dry out a bit between watering. Over-watering is much worse than being too dry. Lightly moist is his happy place. We water again once the top 2cm to 3cm is dry. About weekly in summer, and fortnightly in winter, but best to dip a finger in his soil and decide what he needs and when. The drier the air and more light he gets, the more often he may need water, so upping the humidity is a clever solution too if you want to water less. We give our Philodendron gang a full drench each water then let them drip dry and back to their shelf or cover pot. If you're going to water in position, then tip out excess water from the saucer or cover pot within 30 minutes. Always go for a pot with drainage hole for these boys. No wet feet! A soggy bum is almost guaranteed to be a one way ticket to plant-heaven so keep him well drained. All our Philodendron and Pothos get a half dose of Groconut mixed in every time we water. Plant Runner is superb also if you suspect your chap's depleted the nutrients in his soil (a good option if you're noticing any changes in growth or leaf health). We sell both under the feed & grow category if you want to give them a go. Philodendron Brasil pro tips & problem solving Small leaves The usual list of culprits could be responsible for this one, but in our experience it's most likely due to vining down not climbing up, a lack of humidity, or he's in need of a feed. If everything else is fine but the leaves are just not that big, give your Brasil something to climb up that offers fibres to hold on to. Support plus going up, not hanging down, produces much bigger leaves in our experience (we have both climbers and hangers in our collection). Higher humidity also helps him produce bigger leaves. Another possible reason is a lack of something, although if it's due to this you'll usually find other signs of health issues too, so check more signs below. A good feed with Groconut or Plant Runner could be just what he needs. Less variegation, reverting to full green This one's almost always a light issue. Being variegated, he has higher light requirements than his green heartleaf sister, so consider a change in position, otherwise yes, he might revert to full green. If your chap's chucked out a fully green leaf already, consider chopping it off, back to where the last leaf was still variegated. You can also check the stem to see if there's an obvious variegation stripe or not. We've propagated fully green leaves before and find the new plant always turns out to stay reverted (a free way to get yourself a heartleaf Philodendron!). Fully lime green leaves with no variegation You could also have the reverse problem of a reverted green leaf, and have a fully lime leaf instead. This isn't a death sentence as it sometimes is with other variegated plants as even the lighter green on a Brasil has chlorophyll to keep him going. Up to you on whether you want to chop back to the previous variegated leaf or keep the fully lime one. Just keep in mind the next leaf is also likely to continue fully lime, or have minimal variegation also. We like to make the call to chop back sooner rather than a few leaves later when you have to chop more off. Doing it sooner only loses one leaf worth of nutrients feeding the rest of the plant so has less impact on the plant as a whole. Yellowing leaves Usually just a sign of an old leaf near the end of its life. If it's only on one side of the plant though, he could need a new spot, as focused yellowing on one side and/or on newer leaves, is usually a sign of too much light. If it's not just one old leaf going yellow, or one area on the side he gets the most light, yellowing leaves can be a sign of a more serious problem. The most common cause in that case is over-watering. If the soil's too wet, let him fully dry before you need water. Consider using paper towels on the top soil and under his pot to absorb the excess also if it's looking really dire. Keep changing them until they've stopped absorbing the excess. Curling leaves We see this a lot with these guys but luckily it's not normally a biggie. The most likely cause is under-watering, having left to get dry for too long. An easy fix. It can also be that the air is too dry, or your boy is cold and needs a warmer spot. Check for draughts, take him out of the path of the air con or heat pump, or give him a water if he's dry, and he should come right pretty fast. Drooping or wilting leaves If your boy's gone droopy or wilted, that's another sign of thirst. If his soil's dry, and he's really not looking good, try a bottom soak for about 20 minutes and let him absorb what he needs roots-first. We find bottoms-up can be better for recovery. Dusty leaves This one's on you! There's nothing wrong with him as such, but dusty leaves will eventually harm his health. Those lovely smooth leaves tend to be a dust magnet, so wipe frequently with a damp soft cloth or take him in the shower, or just go a bit overboard so he's dripping after misting and let him air dry. Dry leaves Normally just due to older leaves that have shriveled and dried. Every spring we have a good hunt around all our jungle for old leaves to be removed. It's a good time to tidy up to make room for all that lovely new spring growth. Rootbound Philodendron can be rapid growers, so if those roots are busy growing out of the pot, lift your Brasil out of his pot to take a look. If he's root bound, repot one size up. If you want him to grow wider, try two sizes up (about 5cm more in diameter), to encourage him to fill out more. Pet safe? Sadly, no, the Philodendron Brasil is not pet safe, same as the rest of the Philodendron family. Nibbling or digesting the leaves can irritate the mouth, throat and stomach, and if your pet has a bad reaction, could cause swelling which can cause breathing issues. Keep your Brasil out of reach of curious pets and kids. They're safe to touch, just a big no-no for eating! LTLC Rating (Love That Leaf Care Rating) Almost a 1 out of 5, but we decided to give the Philodendron Brasil a 2 out of 5 on the very unscientific LTLC scale (based on our own experience owning them in NZ conditions). He's an easy care chap provided you remember to water about once every week or two as needed - but not too often - and if you have a spot for him that's bright but not in direct sunlight. Voila! Variegated gorgeousness to admire at home. Brownie points for being so insta-worthy too. In our books no collection's complete without this handsome chap."

Native to Madagascar, the eye-catching spiky tree is a great entry plant for household gardeners wanting an indoor tree—it's easy to care for, drought-tolerant, and nearly indestructible. This slow-growing tree can take a decade to reach a few feet tall but can eventually grow to about 20 feet. However, it is generally grown as a potted houseplant and kept pruned to 6 feet or less. Keep the dragon tree away from pets because it's toxic to animals if ingested.1 dracaena marginata on a side table Credit: The Spruce / Krystal Slagle Common Names Dragon tree, dragon plant, Madagascar dragon tree Botanical Name Dracaena marginata Family Asparagaceae Plant Type Broadleaf evergreen Mature Size 15–20 ft. tall, 3–10 ft. wide Sun Exposure Full sun, partial shade Soil Type Loamy, well-drained Soil pH Neutral to acidic Bloom Time Spring (rarely flowers indoors) Flower Color White Hardiness Zones 10–12 (USDA) Native Areas Madagascar Toxicity Toxic to dogs, toxic to cats1 Dragon Tree Tips for Beginners Where to Put It: Place your dragon tree in a spot that receives bright to medium indirect sunlight. How to Water It: Dragon trees are drought-tolerant plants, so give it a good watering once every three weeks. Soil Type: Use a loose, well-drained potting mix when growing dragon trees, as they'll thrive best in this mixture. Dragon Tree Care Dragon trees are very popular as large potted plants for homes and offices. Here are the most important care requirements. Plant in well-draining soil Water regularly during their growing season. Place in bright, indirect light, though they can thrive in a variety of light conditions. Fertilize conservatively at the beginning of spring. dracaena marginata with red edges Credit: The Spruce / Krystal Slagle closeup of dracaena marginata leaves dracaena marginata tricolor dried out leaves indicate the need for more water Light Place your dragon tree in an area with bright, indirect light. These plants can also survive in partial shade. Keep in mind that plants kept in lower light situations will grow slower and produce smaller leaves with less intense color. Additionally, take care not to place your dragon tree in a spot that receives direct rays of sunlight—its foliage can burn easily.2 Soil Plant your dragon tree in a loose, well-draining potting mix, ensuring that the plant's pot has enough room for its extensive root system—loamy soil amended with peat moss is ideal. Some dragon tree varieties are imported from Hawaii with lava rock—in this case, remove a third of the rock and replace it with the potting mix. Don't Miss How to Grow Lemon Trees lemon tree Growing Jacaranda Trees in Your Yard Jacaranda tree with light purple flowers in front of palm tress and sky with clouds Water Dragon tree is very drought-tolerant, meaning it can be easily overwatered. To prevent overwatering, wait until the top half of the soil is dry before giving the plant another watering. This could mean watering every three weeks or more. Temperature and Humidity Keep your dragon tree in their preferred warmer temperatures of between 70°F and 80°F. Regular household humidity should be fine for them, but if your house is particularly dry, you can consider misting the plant lightly from a spray bottle every few days. Fertilizer Feed a dragon tree lightly at the beginning of spring with a balanced controlled-release liquid fertilizer. Although they have a relatively low need for fertilizer and it is not an essential component to having a thriving plant, it can support new growth. Is This Plant Right for You? DRAGON TREE PLANT IS A GOOD CHOICE FOR YOU IF: You don't have pets, or have a location to place this plant where your pets can't access it. You're bad at keeping up with watering plants regularly, so something more drought-tolerant is better for you. You don't mind having to repot a plant annually. Types of Dragon Tree Although there are several varieties of dragon tree, the most commonly found at plant stores (and used as household plants) include: Dracaena marginata 'Tricolor': This varietal has dark red margins, green leaves, and an ivory stripe down the leaf center. D. marginata 'Colorama': This dragon tree may appear to be completely pink, but it's actually variegated with white and green stripes. It will need very bright light to keep its unique colors. D. marginata 'Bicolor': True to its name, this dragon tree varietal has red and green stripes. Tips for Buying In-Store Check for pests. Look underneath leaves and along the stem to make sure no critters follow you home. Avoid plants with brown spots on leaves. Read the plant label. Make sure that this plant works for you, your lifestyle, and your space. Pruning It's perfectly normal for a dragon tree to self-shed dead leaves—just pick them up and discard them. To keep the plant trimmed and neat, remove leaves that look like they are about to fall off or cut back stems with sterile, sharp pruning shears to tidy up the tree. Sterilize your pruning tool with a clean rag doused in a common household item, such as rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide, then rinse with water, and wipe the tool dry before using it on your plant. Pruning Tip No pruners? No problem! We've tested over 10 top-rated pruners to help you choose the right one for your comfort and personal needs—there's an option for everyone. Propagating Dragon Tree You can propagate your dragon tree using stem cuttings rooted in water. It's so easily done that the varietal is often used in dish gardens and readily propagated by nurseries and retailers. It's best to do this in the spring when the plant is growing vigorously. It takes just about three weeks for the cuttings to sprout roots, and using a rooting hormone isn’t necessary. Using a sterile, sharp scissor, cut a long length of stem that's about 8 inches. Remove any low-hanging leaves. Put the cutting in moistened potting soil. Place the cutting in bright, but indirect sunlight. Once new leaves have sprouted, you'll know the plant has grown some new roots, and you can care for the plant as usual. Potting and Repotting Dragon Tree Make sure to check your dragon tree at least once a year to see if it should be repotted into a bigger pot. Check the bottom of the container for roots coming through the drainage holes, which is a sign that the tree is root-bound and in need of a larger container. Choose a new pot with a diameter about 2 inches larger than its current container. Make sure that it has one or more drainage holes. Because these trees grow so slowly, they generally require repotting only every second—or even third—year. In the meantime, you can refresh the potting soil annually to replace any of the mixture that has become compacted. Planters for Dragon Tree Plants When checking your dragon tree plant annually, you'll likely have to size up a planter for repotting. Here are our favorite indoor planters to pick from. To prevent overwatering, you can also go with one of these self-watering planters. Common Pests Although they are fairly disease-resistant, dragon trees are susceptible to scale insects, mealybugs, and thrips.3 Mealybugs are easy to identify as they leave small, sticky, cottony deposits on the leaves of the tree. Dragon tree plants are also at risk of acquiring the common plant pest, spider mites.4 They tend to occur when temperatures are warm and the air is very dry; however, mites are very difficult to see until they have already damaged the plant. Pests to Watch If you spot any of these pests on your dragon tree, fight back with neem oil, insecticidal soap, or horticultural oil. Mix them with the recommended amount of water and spray on the leaves, stems, and soil. Common Problems with Dragon Tree While dragon trees are fairly easy to maintain, there are a few things to watch for. Leaves Falling Off Overwatering can cause the leaves of dragon trees to become yellow and fall off. These trees are sensitive to excessive moisture in their roots. To avoid this, check the soil regularly. If the top 2 inches of soil feel too wet, it's a sign that you may have gone too far with watering. Drooping Leaves If you notice the leaves of your dragon tree drooping, it could be a sign that the plant is thirsty. You should avoid waiting for the plant to dry out completely before watering it. If the lower leaves are drooping significantly more than the rest of the plant, it could be a symptom of root rot. To avoid any problems, also ensure that you are not over-watering the plant. Brown Leaves or Leaf Tips If the soil is too moist or too dry, dragon tree leaves may start to brown. Make sure you're striking the right balance when irrigating. Additionally, lack of humidity can lead to browning tips and eventual leaf loss. Improve humidity by placing the plant on a dish filled with pebbles and water or use a humidifier. If the plant develops brown tips on its leaves, that's usually a sign the water you're using has too much salt or fluoride, which can cause discoloration. Water your dragon tree with distilled or non-fluoridated water to avoid fluoride buildup. Crispy Leaves If you notice that the foliage on your dragon tree is crunchy, it could be a sign that the plant is receiving too much direct sunlight. When exposed to bright light, the leaves can curl and become crispy. Keep the plant in indirect sunlight or partial shade for best results. Yellowing Leaves In some instances, you may notice the leaves of your dragon tree turning yellow, which could be the result of too much direct sun. The leaves can scorch, become discolored, and start to droop.2 Move the plant to a spot receiving more indirect or filtered sun before excess light causes permanent damage. Yellowing leaves could also be a sign the plant needs more or less water. Make sure you strike the right balance. Is this the right plant for you? A DRAGON TREE IS A GOOD CHOICE IF: You want a low-maintenance houseplant that doesn't need frequent watering. You have a sunny corner perfect for a small tree. You don't have pets. FAQ What are the disadvantages of growing Dracaena marginata? The cons of growing a dragon tree involve pests. This plant attracts scale insects and mites. It's also a plant that requires just the right amount of water so it doesn't develop root rot. How tall does a dragon tree grow? The dragon tree is a slow-growing plant that takes around eight to 10 years to reach a height of 2 to 3 feet. Indoors, it could reach 6 feet tall. Outdoors, it could reach 20 feet tall after another 30 years. Do dragon trees need big pots? Dragon tree pots should be big enough to accommodate their extensive root systems. Although they may not require a large pot right away, this will change as they mature. What is the lifespan of a dragon tree? In theory, a dragon tree could live for hundreds of years in the wild. As a houseplant in optimal conditions with appropriate repotting, a dragon tree can live up to 15 years. Does the dragon tree bloom? Dragon trees rarely flower and bloom when grown indoors. The dragon tree boasts tiny white flowers in the spring when grown outdoors in optimal conditions."

These plants are great for beginners because they’re drought tolerant and not at all fussy about their light conditions. It’s the perfect combination of beauty and hardiness that makes a great houseplant! Dracaena marginata is native to Madagascar and is also called the Madagascar dragon tree (or just dragon tree). This tree can grow up to 20 feet tall outdoors but won’t get taller than 6 feet indoors, especially if you prune it back. It’s a member of the dracaena family, which contains around 120 species of plants native to Africa, northern Australia, and South Asia. This plant was also used in NASA’s famous Clean Air Study and was shown to help remove formaldehyde from indoor air! Here’s how to care for your own dracaena marginata indoors. The Ultimate Guide to Dracaena Marginata dracaena marginata Potting and Soil Choose a pot with drainage that’s just a few inches larger than the root ball so the root system has room to grow. As for soil, buy or make a loamy, well-draining mix with a pH of 6-7. Dracaena marginata is a slow-growing plant, so you’ll only need to repot every few years to keep this plant happy. If the soil gets compacted (hardened and pulling away from the edge of the pot) you might want to change it out for fresh soil. Light Dracaena marginata prefers bright, indirect light, but if you’re short on light in your home, no worries! This plant will also do just fine in lower light conditions, but it won’t grow as quickly or use water as efficiently. (So just be careful not to overwater.) Keep your plant out of direct sunlight though, as this can burn the leaves. Water These plants are quite drought-resistant and don’t require a lot of water, so wait until the top half of the soil is completely dry before watering. Then, water thoroughly with distilled water, until water starts to run out the drainage holes at the bottom of the pot. It’s important to use distilled water or another non-fluoridated water because fluoride and other salts in the water can cause the tips of dracaena’s leaves to get brown and crispy (and this goes for all species of dracaena). This is one of the most common issues with dracaena plants, but it’s an easy problem to fix! Temperature and Humidity Dracaena will be happy with temperatures in the 70-80 degree F. range, and they don’t require a lot of humidity. (See, we told you they were easy!) Keep your plant away from drafts and vents that could dry out the leaves, though. Fertilizer This plant grows mostly in the spring and summer, so you’ll want to fertilize a little during that time. A little Indoor Plant Food in your regular watering routine is perfect! Pruning and Propagating You can propagate your dracaena marginata with stem cuttings in water. They root fairly easily, but you can use a little Houseplant Propagation Promoter to help it along, provide nutrients, and protect your cutting from disease. These plants are slow growers, so you won’t have too much pruning. But if your tree starts to get a little big or unruly, simply use clean shears to cut it back to your desired shape and size. Simple! dracaena marginata Pests Dracaenas are tough plants, but they are susceptible to spider mites and occasionally mealybugs. If you notice insects, remove as many as you can by picking them off or spraying them off with a hose or kitchen faucet, then spray down the plant with Leaf Armor to protect the leaves and ward off insects. Troubleshooting Yellowing lower leaves – your plant probably needs more water. Browning leaf tips – too much fluoride or other salts in the water. Switch to distilled! Browning, soft leaves – your plant is cold or overwatered. Note: While dracaena marginata is harmless to humans when ingested, it is extremely toxic to pets. If you have curious pets, choose a different plant or keep this plant where your pets can’t get to it. Dracaena marginata is a great plant for beginners who want a striking statement plant to brighten up their space. Give one a try and let us know how it goes!"

    "content": "Madagascar Dragon Tree: Dracaena Marginata Care Guide The Madagascar Dragon Tree is a striking plant known for its slender, spiky leaves and unique growth habit. With its tall, cane-like trunks and elegant, architectural form, it’s a favorite for those looking to add a modern and/or Asian-inspired touch to their space. Despite its exotic appearance, a Dracaena marginata is surprisingly easy to care for—if you follow a few key guidelines. The two most common reasons houseplants don’t thrive are improper placement and overwatering. Avoid these mistakes, and your plant will stay happy and look great for years to come. Botanical Name: Dracaena Marginata Common Name: Madagascar Dragon Tree, Red Edged Dracaena, Dragon Tree A large dracaena marginata madagascar dragon tree in a greenhouse. Dracaena marginatas come in many forms, & all of them are interesting! Table of Contents Madagascar Dragon Tree Traits Size / Form Growth Rate Uses Dracaena Marginata Care Guide Exposure Watering Temperature Madagascar Dragon Tree FAQS View more Madagascar Dragon Tree Traits Size / Form You’ll see the smaller plants for sale in 4″, 6″, or 8″ grow pots, which are considered tabletop plants. When you move up to the 10″, 12″, and 14″ grow pot sizes, these are classified as floor plants. The tallest I’ve seen one growing as an indoor plant is 12″. The most common heights range from 5′ to 8′. They’re available in many forms—some are tall and slim with a single stem, while others have multiple canes of varying heights for a layered look. The woody stems (aka canes) give them a tree-like appearance, adding to their sculptural, modern vibe. Over time, these canes develop interesting twists and bends, making each plant unique. Growth Rate They’re slow growing. The more light they get and in warm temperatures, the faster they grow. Uses On tabletops, but more commonly as a floor plant. Dracaena Marginata Care Guide Exposure They like bright, indirect light. Keep yours out of direct, hot sun (in a west or south-facing window) because the leaves will burn against the hot glass, especially in summer. Mine grows in my bright bedroom in sunny Tucson, AZ. It’s next to an east-facing sliding glass door and gets a lot of bright light all day. On the other hand, keep it out of low light conditions – no dark corners, please. If not getting enough light, the plant will lean towards a light source, get a leggy, sparse appearance, and skinnier, droopy leaves. If the light level lowers significantly during the winter months, consider relocating the plant to a spot with more light. You might need to rotate your plant every few months so it receives light on all sides. Close up of a tall dracaena marginata madagascar dragon tree with staggered canes. Watering Water when the top half of the soil is dry. In the warmer months, I water mine in a 14″ pot (7′ tall) every 7-10 days because the sun shines almost every day here in the Sonoran Desert. Water less in the winter. These plants grow much slower in the cooler, darker months and require a period of rest. In the winter, I back off on the watering frequency to every 10-14 days. It’s not the active growing season; the light levels and temps tend to be lower. I always use room-temperature water. I can’t give you a watering schedule. You must adjust the frequency according to your plant’s pot size, soil mix, and home environment. You want a happy medium with this plant, not bone dry or soggy wet. Make sure there’s at least one drainage hole on the bottom of the pot. You want the excess water to flow out, preventing root rot. The tips of this plant will brown if you have salts and/or fluorides in your water. Tap water can cause salt burn on the edges and tips of the leaves over time. Consider using filtered water if your tap water is high in salts or other minerals. I have a tankless r/o water filtration system in the kitchen with a cartridge that puts the good minerals back in. I use it to water all of my houseplants. If you’re a beginner, this guide to watering indoor plants provides more information. Temperature Regarding houseplants, if your home is comfortable for humans, it’ll be the same for your plants. Just keep yours away from any cold drafts and air conditioning or heating vents. Humidity This plant is native to the subtropics. They love high humidity but can handle regular household humidity just fine. Small brown leaf tips appear when there’s a lack of humidity. Mine has quite a few, but they don’t bother me. I have a humidity meter in my dining room. It’s inexpensive but gets the job done and works fine, displaying the temperature and humidity. I run my Canopy humidifiers at night when the humidity reads low, often here in Arizona! Any small humidifier placed nearby should help. Consider misting your marginata two or three times a week. Fertilizing We have a long growing season here in Tucson, from mid-February through October. I fertilize with Grow Big, Liquid Kelp, and Maxsea or Sea Grow five to seven times during the growing season (mainly spring and summer). I alternate these liquid fertilizers and don’t use them all together. When my plants start putting out new growth and new leaves, it’s my sign to start feeding. Your start date may be later in a different climate zone with a shorter season. Feeding your plants two or three times a year with a houseplant fertilizer may be sufficient. Fertilizing too often or with excessive fertilizer can cause salts to accumulate and eventually lead to root and leaf burn. This will show up as brown spots and edges on the leaves. If you fertilize more than three times a year, you can try using the fertilizer at half-strength. The label on the jar or bottle will guide you. It’s best to avoid fertilizing a stressed houseplant, ie, bone dry or soaking wet. More on fertilizing houseplants here. Close up of a dracaena marginata in candelabra form. This is a close up of my Dracaena marginata in candelabra form. Soil Dracaenas like a rich, somewhat chunky potting mix with good drainage. You don’t want the roots to stay too wet otherwise they’ll rot out. The mix I use for dracaenas is roughly 1/2 potting soil and 1/2 rock. Use a potting soil that is peat-based and formulated for indoor plants. I alternate between Happy Frog and Ocean Forest. For the rock, I used clay pebbles. I also tossed in a few handfuls of chunky pumice and a few of compost. I topped with a 1/4? layer of worm compost for added nourishment. Here’s more on potting soil for indoor plants. Repotting The best time to repot houseplants is in the spring or summer months, during the active growing season. If you live in a warm climate, early fall can also work. The faster your plant grows, the sooner it will need repotting. I repot my large dracaenas every four to seven years. When repotting, make sure the new pot has drainage holes to prevent excess water buildup, which can lead to root rot. It’s best to move up one pot size from the current pot. If the roots are tightly packed, gently loosen the root ball with your hands before placing it into fresh soil. Here are the step-by-step instructions on how I repotted my Dracaena Lisa. Pruning The main reasons I prune this plant are to remove the lower leaves (on dracaena plants, they yellow and die; that’s how the plant grows) and to control the height. These plants can get tall and spindly over time, so you can cut the stems down to stimulate new growth. The piece you’ve cut off can be easily propagated in water. These plants are native to the humid tropics, and tipping occurs because our homes are dry. You can cut off the brown tips if you’d like. Be sure your scissors are clean and sharp otherwise the leaves will tear. Propagation I’ve propagated this plant using two methods. The first is division, which is possible if the plant has multiple stems. The second is by stem cuttings. Trim the stem cuttings to 10 – 20 inches and propagate them in water. You can also use a light mix. Pests Your marginata may get spider mites, mealy bugs, or scale at some point. For the spider mite, use a spray with a few drops of mild dish soap in water. You can use insecticidal soap for a bad infestation. Be sure to get the undersides of the leaves because that’s where these critters hang out. You can use rubbing alcohol diluted by half with water dipped on a cotton swab for the mealy or spray if your plant is larger. Be sure to get deep inside the nodes. Strong but gentle spraying off the plant should do the trick if the infestation is not too bad. Any of these treatments need to be done at 7-10 days intervals for 2-4 weeks. Sorry, one treatment won’t knock them out. More on identifying & treating mealybugs, spider mites, & scale. Cleaning Keeping Dracaena marginata plants clean helps them look better and improves their health. If dirt/dust builds up on their leaves, it can impede their breathing. Spray the leaves with water or take the plant to the sink, tub, or outside to hose it down. They like humidity and will love you for doing this. More on cleaning houseplants. Close up of a black kitty chewing on the leaves of a dracaena marginata madagascar dragon tree. By the way, kitties love to chomp on these tender, crispy leaves. This is my Oscar who is 14 years old & naps all day but gets the energy to gnaw away on this plant any chance he gets. The plant has been moved to safer grounds high atop a bookshelf where he stares at it daily with longing. Sorry Oscar! Pet Safety All dracaenas are considered to be toxic to pets. I consult the ASPCA website for information on this subject. Here’s a list of pet-friendly houseplants. Madagascar Dragon Tree FAQS How should I water my Dracaena? alTap water can cause salt burn on the edges and tips of the leaves over time. It’s a good idea to use filtered water if your tap water is high in salts or other minerals. I have a tankless r/o water filtration system in the kitchen with a cartridge that puts the good minerals back in. I use it to water all my houseplants. How can I tell if my plant is overwatered or underwatered? Yellow leaves, mushy stems, and wilting can indicate overwatering, while brown leaf tips, leaf drop, and yellow leaves are a few indicators of underwatering. How can I treat and prevent brown or dried leaf tips? Brown tips result from low humidity levels, improper watering, or minerals in tap water. You can help your plant by increasing humidity, adjusting the watering frequency, or using filtered water. How can I tell if my Madagascar dragon tree is experiencing environmental stress? Watch for signs such as drooping, discoloration, curling leaves, soft stems, decreased leaf size, or unexpected leaf drop. These often indicate something isn’t right with the light exposure, watering, humidity, or temperature that may need adjusting. Video Guide Conclusion: The Dracaena marginata is an easy-going plant that brings a showy, modern vibe to any space. Give it the right exposure (bright, indirect sunlight), and avoid overwatering. Keep an eye out for any signs of stress; with just a little proper care, your Madagascar Dragon tree will do just fine!"

    "content": "How to Grow and Care for Calathea Orbifolia This particular plant is tricky for beginners, but worth the effort. The round-leaved calathea (Geoppertia orbifolia) is still most often referred to informally by its prior botanical name, calathea orbifolia. The silver-green stripes on its luxuriant, large leaves make it a bold statement plant, but it's somewhat fussy and can be high-maintenance. However, this tricky plant has lots going for it if you're willing to put in the extra effort. Calathea orbifolia is fast-growing, pet-friendly, lush, and eye-catching. Common Name Calathea orbifolia, round-leaved calathea Botanical Name Geoppertia orbifolia Family Marantaceae Plant Type Perennial, herbaceous Mature Size 2-3 ft. tall, 1-2 ft. wide Sun Exposure Partial Soil Type Moist but well-drained Soil pH Acid, neutral, alkaline Hardiness Zones 11-12 (USDA) Native Area South America Calathea Orbifolia Care These plants need plenty of attention to thrive, and trying to keep calatheas alive can be a challenge, even for the most experienced plant parents. One of the reasons they're often nurtured in greenhouses is their need for a warm, humid environment. If you can mimic the tropical conditions they love, you'll get to appreciate the beauty of the calathea orbifolia in your own home. Here are the main care requirements: Place the plant in bright, indirect light. Fertilize monthly during the growing season with a balanced liquid fertilizer. Provide a high humidity, warm, draft-free environment; think moisture-laden air, shady positions, and balmy temperatures. Prepare a loose potting mix that retains moisture. Calathea orbifolia plant with round leaves with variegated stripes clustered together Credit: The Spruce / Adrienne Legault Calathea orbifolia with rounded and striped leaves closeup Calathea orbifolia plant stems under large rounded leaves Light It's all about encouraging lush, healthy-looking foliage with a calathea orbifolia, and offering the right diffused light is one of the keys to success. Direct sun results in ugly brown spots, leaf scorch and fading patternation. However, if the light conditions are too low, the leaves won't look their fullest or healthiest. Rotating the plant every month helps to promote balanced growth too. Soil Calathea orbifolia has fragile, petite roots, so a fine, loose, and lightweight potting mix works best. Because these plants need plenty of moisture, you want to opt for something that has good water retaining qualities. Mixes designed for African violets work well. If you want to make your own, opt for a slightly acidic mix. Something like one part peat moss (or, as a sustainable alternative, coconut coir), one part perlite, and one part vermiculite. Make sure the pot has adequate drainage holes. While Calathea orbifolia likes consistent moisture, water-logging results in root rot. Water Watering errors are where lots of first-time round-leaved calathea owners go wrong. Getting the balance right can be tricky, as too much watering leads to root rot and the eventual death of your plant. Always check the top couple of inches of soil with your finger. If it feels damp and soil comes off on your finger, wait a couple of days and check again. If the soil feels dry, it's usually time to water. Use a moisture meter if you're not sure. While they need consistent moisture, these plants can't tolerate soggy roots. The little and often approach works best, and watering from the bottom helps moisture reach the roots and the center of the pot. Watering from the top often results in the water draining right down through to the bottom. Make sure to check the soil after a few hours. If the soil is moist right up to the top, drain any excess water from the saucer or tray below the pot. Using distilled or filtered water or tap water left out overnight helps prevent the crisping leaf edges or yellowing leaves that some of the problematic minerals can cause. Temperature and Humidity These plants don't appreciate chilly temperatures, draughts, or blasting heating or A/C. They need consistent warmth and humidity. Temperatures below 60 degrees are problematic. Maintain average home temperates between 65 and 75 degrees. Round-leaved calathea are good candidates for bright, warm bathrooms. Humidity levels above 50 percent are needed to keep your plant looking healthy, although 60 percent humidity is more likely to help your plant to thrive. If your house doesn't offer this naturally, consider using a humidifier, placing your plant in a large terrarium or under a glass dome, or using a tray of pebbles with water in the base under your plant. Regular misting might help to improvise humidity levels too. Fertilizer Although applying a weak dose of nitrogen-rich fertilizer around once a month during the growing season can help promote lush, healthy foliage, don't go overboard. Too much or too strong fertilizer can scorch the leaves. Pruning Calathea orbifolia doesn't have a high-maintenance pruning schedule. Just remove dying or dead leaves by cutting the stems to around an inch above the soil line. This helps direct energy to new and healthier growth. Always use clean pruning shears or scissors to reduce the risk of transferring fungal diseases. Propagating Calathea Orbifolia Propagating calathea orbifolia can be challenging but is not impossible. Because it's done by root division, you'll only be able to do this if you have a large, healthy, mature plant. For best results, consider propagating at the same time as you're repotting your plant. Where possible, stick with late spring or early summer propagation when temperatures are at their warmest and growth is most vigorous. Here's how to propagate your round-leaved calathea. Gently remove the plant from the pot. Usually, you'll see baby clumps growing off the side of the mother plant. These are what you want to break off, keeping a tuber root and one leaf. Gently separate the roots, trying not to break them. Don't delay in planting the divided baby section in a loose, well-drained, sterile potting mix. The delicate roots shouldn't be left exposed for too long, Keep the new plant consistently moist but not saturated. Cover the division with a zip-lock plastic bag for a few weeks to help retain humidity and moisture levels. After around three weeks, you can remove the bag once you notice new growth. Potting and Repotting Calathea Orbifolia If you see the roots starting to poke out the pot's drainage holes, this is a sign repotting is on the cards. Calathea orbifolia isn't a fan of having its delicate roots messed with, so only repot when you really need to and be gentle to minimize the chance of transplant shock. Select a pot around two to three inches larger than the original one, and don't worry about getting all the old soil off the rootball. It's better to fill around whatever original potting soil comes with your rootball instead of trying to replace it all. Common Pests Spider mites are fans of the foliage of calathea orbifolia. However, they prefer a low humidity environment, so if you're spotting these pests, it could be a sign that you need to offer your plant a more humid climate. Common Problems with Calathea Orbifolia As you might expect from a challenging plant like the round-leaved calathea, it can be prone to a few issues if it doesn't get the right care and attention. Some things to look out for include: Leaves Turning Yellow Overwatering is one of the most common problems for the calathea orbifolia and a sign you might be making this mistake is the stunning leaves turning yellow. Curling Leaves and Brown Tips If you aren't giving your calathea orbifolia enough water or the humidity levels aren't high enough, the leaves can start to curl, and the tips can turn brown. However, older leaves often naturally develop a bit of browning on their tips, so it isn't always something to panic about. These symptoms can also signify that your plant is getting too much intense exposure to sun. To prevent sun scorch, always opt for a position with dappled rather than direct light. Drooping or Dropping Leaves A bit of leaf drooping during the day can happen even with the healthiest of round-leaved calathea. If they perk up again at night, it's usually nothing to worry about. However, persistent droop or leaf drop can be a sign that you need to offer your plant more water and humidity. FAQ How fast do calathea orbifolia plants grow? These plants are relatively fast growers. With the right conditions, they can reach heights of over two feet, with leaves that spread almost one foot within a year or two. What other plants are similar to calathea orbifolia? If you're searching for a similar-looking tropical houseplant but one that's a little easier to care for, why not try Ctenanthe setosa 'Gray Star' with its unique silver-gray foliage pattern. It's still not wholly low-maintenance, but it isn't quite as particular as the calathea. Can I grow calethea orbifolia outdoors? These plants are true tropical species, and they have a limited range of USDA hardiness zones in which they can grow outdoors. However, if you live somewhere like Florida or Hawaii and have guaranteed year-round warmth and high humidity levels, then you can definitely try showing off the round-leaved calathea in your yard."

The top sides of the leaves look as if they have been painted with beautiful brushstrokes – they're often intricately patterned, in many shades of green. The undersides of the leaves are often burgundy red. This striking foliage has earned calatheas several nicknames, including the peacock plant, cathedral window plant, zebra plant and rattlesnake plant. Calatheas are sometimes called the prayer plant. They are closely related to Ctenanthe and the maranta plant, both also known as the prayer plant because they close their leaves up at night. Many calathea varieties have recently been moved into the genus Goeppertia, so you may now find them being sold under this name. Calatheas hail from the forest floor of tropical rainforests, which gives plenty of clues as to their care – they cope well in low light levels but need plenty of humidity in order to thrive. You may notice your calathea moving its leaves throughout the day as it orientates itself towards the light – something it has evolved to do in its native environment. Planting perennials in autumn How to grow calathea Calatheas need specific care in order to thrive. They need a consistently warm spot and bright but indirect light – keep them out of direct sunshine. Keep the soil moist from spring to autumn, and provide some humidity by misting the leaves daily or standing on a tray of moist pebbles. Calatheas need to be watered with filtered or distilled water, or rainwater – not tap water.

Avoid direct sunlight, as this will scorch the leaves, and keep away from draughts. Provide a minimum temperature of 15°C and avoid rooms with regular temperature fluctuations. Bathrooms are ideal for calatheas, as they love a humid atmosphere.

Repot in spring, every couple of years, into a slightly larger pot. Caring for a calathea Keep the soil evenly moist (but not soaking wet) at all times from spring to autumn – watering little but often is ideal. Use distilled water, filtered water or rainwater as calatheas are sensitive to the chemicals in tap water. Make sure any excess water has drained away. Water less in winter, keeping the soil just moist. Ad Calatheas do best in a humid environment, so mist the leaves daily with tepid water or stand on a tray of gravel or pebbles that is topped up with water. How to raise humidity for house plants Feed your calathea every couple of months with a balanced fertiliser. Wipe the leaves occasionally to remove dust. How to propagate a calathea The best way to propagate a calathea is by dividing it. When you repot the plant in spring, gently pull apart the rootball with your fingers – you should find that a clump at the side comes away naturally. Check that each clump has a part of the root system. Repot both plants into fresh compost, in pots a little larger than the new root ball. If a clump doesn’t come away naturally, you can cut through the rootball with a clean, sharp knife.

Your plant should bounce back quickly once you have watered it. Ensure that any excess water drains away afterwards. Yellowing or wilting leaves could also be caused by overwatering. Calatheas suffer in soggy compost as it causes the roots to rot (you may notice that the base of the plant is blackened). Allow the compost to dry out before watering again, and always let excess water drain away. Brown patches could be caused by sunburn. Move your plant out of direct sunlight. Faded leaves mean that the plant is getting too much light – move to a shadier spot. Small brown patches on the leaves, surrounded by a yellow halo, could be leaf spot. This can be a problem if water has splashed on the leaves. Remove any affected leaves to stop the problem spreading. Avoid using tap water. Brown edges on the leaves or brown tips can be caused by dry air – so boost humidity around the plant, either by misting or by standing on a tray of damp pebbles. You may have also overfed your plant, or watered it with hard water. Red spider mite can affect calatheas. The leaves and stems of the plant will be covered in fine webbing and the upper surface of the leaf becomes mottled. If you look carefully, using a magnifying glass, you will see mites and eggs on the undersides of the leaves. Improve air circulation boost humidity. Alternatively, use sprays containing, fatty acids or plant oils.

    "content": "Calathea orbifolia: care & propagation Calathea orbifolia is a popular houseplant with large, striped foliage. Whilst beautiful, this plant has some specific care requirements and so is best suited to slightly more experienced houseplant owners. High humidity, consistently moist soil, even heat, and regular fertilising are just a few of the basic care requirements for a healthy Calathea orbifolia. As long as you can meet these requirements and find it an ideal location, this remarkable tropical plant will make an excellent addition to your houseplant collection. Contents Calathea orbifolia: origin and characteristics Native to the tropical rainforests of South America, Calathea orbifolia, is one of many species in the Calathea genus, known as prayer plants. This herbaceous perennial belongs to the Marantaceae family and can grow up to 80 cm tall. It is not winter hardy and does not tolerate temperatures below 5 °C. Calathea orbifolia with its lush green foliage, is one of the many types of Calathea that make beautiful statement houseplants. The leaves of Calathea orbifolia are light green with silvery-green stripes and can grow up to 40 cm long. These round leaves with slightly wavy edges give the plant its botanical name – ‘orbifolia’, which is a conjunction of the Latin words orbis, meaning round, and folia meaning leaf. The leaves of this Calathea move throughout the day and curl up at night, as is typical for many prayer plants. Calathea orbifolia’s flowers are white and star-shaped, but it rarely blooms as a houseplant. Calathea orbifolia on table outdoors With its pale silvery-green stripes, Calathea orbifolia is a unique member of the prayer plant family [Photo: Chatchai Somwat/ Shutterstock.com] Location, temperature, and soil Calathea orbifolia grows in the undergrowth of forests in nature, sothrives in bright shady areas that mimic these conditions. While this plant requires a lot of indirect light, it does not tolerate direct sunlight. It also needs high humidity in order to thrive, so it is a good idea to place your Calathea in a bathroom, for example, behind a sheer curtain. Alternatively, you can also place the plant’s pot on a saucer filled with expanded clay and water. This is another method of increasing humidity by allowing water to evaporate into the plant’s immediate surroundings. Calathea orbifolia prefers temperatures ranging from 18 °C to 26 °C all year. Do not let the temperatures drop below 15 °C in the winter. Calathea orbifolia prefers a loose, humus-rich and well-draining soil. Our Plantura Organic All Purpose Compost, for instance, is ideal for these plants. On top of containing organic and sustainably sourced ingredients, our soil is well-structured and has a slightly acidic pH value, making it suitable for tropical houseplants. It is also peat-free and contains all the necessary nutrients the plant needs for the first few months. For even better drainage, mix in 30% expanded clay. To further prevent waterlogging, add a layer of expanded clay to the bottom of the pot to create a drainage layer. As calathea orbifolia requires evenly moist (but not waterlogged) soil, we also recommend adding a layer of mulch to the top of the soil.

Calathea orbifolia care guide Calathea orbifolia is not the easiest houseplant to care for. During the summer, you can put yours outside in the shade as long as it gets its minimum light requirement of 750 to 2000 lux. Even when kept outdoors, it is important to regularly mist the leaves to ensure sufficient humidity. Tip: High humidity levels not only keep the plant healthy, but also deter a variety of pests that tend to prefer dry air. Watering, pruning, and fertilising As Calathea orbifolia requires constantly moist soil, it is important to water the plant on a regular basis. Water once the top 2 cm of soil is dry, ideally with water low in lime – rainwater works best. These plants do not like to sit in water, so remove any excess water about 15 minutes after watering. In winter, when it is colder and there is less daylight, water less often, but make sure the root ball never dries out completely. Close-up of furled calathea orbifolia leaf Like most types of prayer plants, Calathea orbifolia requires high humidity to stay happy and healthy [Photo: zaidiamri/ Shutterstock.com] Fertilise your Calathea orbifolia during the growing season from spring to autumn. Once every four weeks, apply a half-dose of liquid fertiliser, such as our Plantura Liquid Houseplant Food. Due to its reduced phosphate and sufficient nitrogen content, our fertiliser helps keep prayer plants healthy. It also contains good bacteria which helps strengthen plant roots. Calathea orbifolia require an even supply of nutrients, so the fact that this fertiliser steadily releases nutrients once it comes into contact with soil also makes it ideal for these plants.

It is not necessary to prune Calathea orbifolia, neither for the winter nor to encourage growth, but you can remove any yellow or dry leaves. Repotting can be unnecessarily stressful for your plants, so only repot your Calathea once the roots begin to grow out of the pot. Other than that, simply replace the top layer of substrate once a year. If you are planning to repot your plant, it is best to do so in the spring when the growing period begins. When repotting Calathea orbifolia, treat the roots with care and cut off any dead and rotten ones. Remove the old soil completely before transplanting it into a slightly larger pot. You can propagate this plant by division when repotting. We will go over how to do this further down. Large calathea orbifolia with drooping leaves If well cared for, this prayer plant’s leaves can grow very large [Photo: Jus_Ol/ Shutterstock.com] Common Calathea orbifolia problems Calathea orbifolia gets brown edges: Brown edges or spots on your Calathea leaves are usually a sign that either the soil’s pH level is too low or that there is an excess of nutrients. If this happens, it is best to repot the plant in a fresh, suitable substrate. Calathea orbifolia has drooping leaves: As Calathea leaves move throughout the day, drooping leaves are not necessarily a bad sign. However, if the leaves also become discoloured, drooping leaves can be a sign that the substrate is either too dry or wet. If this happens, check the soil and replace the top layer of substrate. Older soil tends to sink and eventually becomes incapable of absorbing and storing water well. Unhealthy roots, a lack of light, insufficient humidity or draughts can also lead to drooping leaves. Calathea orbifolia develops yellow leaves: If your Calathea’s leaves wilt and turn yellow, the plant is most likely suffering from root rot caused by waterlogging. If this occurs, repot your Calathea into fresh soil, cutting off any rotten roots in the process. Use expanded clay to create a drainage layer when replanting, and always pour out excess water after watering. Nutrient deficiencies caused by too much light or insufficient fertilising can also cause the leaves to wilt and turn yellow. Calathea with browning leaves Yellow, brown or drooping leaves are a sure sign of incorrect care [Photo: mokjc/ Shutterstock.com] Tip: Calathea orbifolia’s leaves curling up at night is not a sign of improper care. This is the plant’s natural adaptation to its surrounding light conditions. How to propagate Calathea orbifolia Propagating Calathea orbifolia plants is not the easiest. While it is possible to propagate the plant by division, you risk damaging the sensitive roots. If you would like to try and propagate your Calathea, ensure the mother plant is healthy and wait until late spring. Ideally, propagate when you are already planning to repot your plant. Remove the Calathea from the pot and remove all soil from its roots. Using a sharp, clean knife, cut off a small piece of the mother plant consisting of at least one leaf and some roots. Calathea cannot repair its roots, so remove any accidentally damaged ones entirely to allow new ones to grow. Plant the daughter plant in its own pot with a well-drained, low-nutrient soil. Here we can recommend our Plantura Organic Herb & Seedling Compost. As it is lower in nutrients, it is ideal for young plants and promotes the formation of strong roots. For additional permeability, mix in 30% crushed expanded clay. Keep the soil moist and place the plant in a shaded spot at a temperature between 24 °C and 30 °C. To up the humidity, cover with a transparent plastic bag, but remember to air out daily. If new leaves start to grow, you know the propagation has been successful. At this point, you can remove the plastic bag for good and proceed by misting daily. During the growing period, fertilise the daughter plant as you would an adult Calathea. In the following spring, you can repot your new Calathea into a more nutrient-rich soil. Young calathea plant in nursery pot Young plants separated from the mother plant can relatively quickly be cared for in the same way as mature Calatheas [Photo: Hanna Helin/ Shutterstock.com] Is Calathea orbifolia toxic? No. Like most, if not all, Calatheas, Calathea orbifolia is not poisonous. It is therefore safe to keep in homes with pets and children. Nevertheless, we advise against ingesting the plant as it is inedible. If you enjoy the silvery pattern on the leaves of Calathea orbifolia, you might like Syngonium as well. These similarly decorative climbers look great in any room."

It is closely related to the banana plant. The bird of paradise plant is named for closely resembling the tropical bird of the same name. It is easier to grow than many tropical plants and makes for a vigorous, rapidly growing indoor plant. It can be moved outside in the summer where it may thrive for a few months. Bird of paradise plants typically flower in the late winter or early spring but can flower at other times of the year when provided optimal conditions. These plants grow with upright leaves emerging directly from the soil and have no trunk. The large leaves range from 12 to 18 inches long and can develop splits in the leaves when exposed to windy conditions or brushed against in a busy hallway. Strelitzia is toxic to cats and dogs.1 Common Name Bird of paradise Botanical Name Strelitzia reginae, Strelitzia nicolai Family Strelitziaceae Plant Type Herbaceous perennial Mature Size 3.5-6 ft. tall, 3-4 ft. wide Sun Exposure Full to partial Soil Type Loamy Soil pH Slightly acidic Bloom Time Late winter to early spring Flower Color Orange or white Hardiness Zones 10-12 (USDA) Native Area Africa (South Africa) Toxicity Toxic to pets1 Bird of Paradise Care Strelitzia works well in massed plantings outside in warm climates but they are more often grown successfully indoors as beautiful houseplants when the following care requirements are met. Plant indoors in a warm spot with bright indirect sunlight. Water regularly as long as the soil is well draining. Feed the plant with compost early in spring before new growth begins. Fertilize every week during the growing season. Move the plant outside in warm summer months and inside during the winter to increase the survival rate. Closeup of bird of paradise strelitzia foliage Credit: The Spruce / Jacob Fox Overhead view of bird of paradise strelitzia Closeup of Bird of paradise strelitzia leaf bird of paradise closeup Light This plant needs bright light, including some direct sunlight, to bloom well. However, it requires shielding in the direct midday summer sun, which can burn the leaves of younger plants.2 A good position is in a room with windows facing east or west. Avoid rooms with only a north-facing window. Soil Use rich, well-drained potting mix for potted plants or a compost mixture. If using a pot, make sure it has ample drainage holes to allow water to flow through the soil and out of the pot. Water Keep the soil continually moist throughout the year. While it should not be waterlogged, expect to water it daily in the spring and summer as it loses moisture through its big leaves. You can water it until you see the water draining from its drainage holes, but make sure it does not sit in a pool of water. If overwatered, the plant will develop crunchy brown leaves. If underwatered, the leaves farthest from the center will turn yellow. Temperature and Humidity Bird of paradise prefers high humidity. You might want to keep a spray bottle handy to mist it if your home is dry. Keep the air temperature above 60 degrees F in the winter. This is not a cold-tolerant plant and it recovers slowly from frost damage. Fertilizer This plant is a heavy feeder. Feed it in the springtime with slow-release pellets or weekly during the growing season with liquid fertilizer. Placement Bird of paradise plants can thrive in many lighting conditions but will do best in bright, indirect sunlight. When growing it indoors, place the plant in a window facing east or north. If you only have areas with direct sunlight, rotate the plant regularly to ensure even growth. Be careful not to overexpose the plant and scorch the foliage. Types of Bird of Paradise There are five Strelitzia species, but only two are commonly grown as indoor plants: S. reginae (orange bird of paradise) and S. nicolai (white bird of paradise). Strelitzia reginae 'Glauca': This orange variety has powdery grayer foliage and stems. Strelitzia reginae 'Humilis' or 'Pygmaea': This orange variety only grows about 3 feet tall. Strelitzia reginae 'Ovata': This orange variety features rounded leaf blades. Strelitzia juncea: The leafless bird of paradise lacks leaf blades, so its stems and leaves look like reeds. Strelitzia caudata: This 25-foot-tall species grows in the higher elevations of South Africa and is also called the mountain bird of paradise. It blooms with white-and-blue petalled flowers and is the rarest plant and hardest to obtain. Pruning Birds of paradise flowers last for about three weeks before dropping their petals and dying. Remove old or damaged plant matter. This is the best way to thin the leaves. Remove the leaves by pulling them off or using sharp cutting instruments. Sterilize the implements in between different plants. If a leaf appears mostly healthy, leave it intact. If your plant has grown large, and you need to do significant cutting down, use loppers, hand pruners, or a pruning saw in the early spring. Do not use hedge trimmers, which leave ragged cuts. You can cut all leaves and stems down to just above the ground. If the plant remains too crowded, use long-handled pruners and remove selected stems and leaves. Propagating Bird of Paradise The best ways to propagate birds of paradise are by division and sowing seeds. Division is easier and quicker than growing from seed. It's best to use mature plants that have previously bloomed for at least three years. Depending on the size of your plant (and its rhizome or root structure), you will need larger instruments like a shovel and saw for in-ground or large plants. For smaller plants, you can use a sharp knife. If potting the division, you will need a new pot and a well-draining potting mix. Here's how to divide strelitzia. To propagate by division: Remove the new growth or offshoots at the base of the plant that has at least three leaves Divide the rhizome below the ground with a shovel, saw, or knife. Repot in a new container with a well-draining potting mix. How to Grow Bird of Paradise From Seed Be patient when growing strelitzia from seeds. It can take two months for the seeds to germinate. Take these steps: Soak seeds in room-temperature water for 24 to 48 hours before planting. Remove any orange stringy material. Nick the seed with a knife or nail file. Plant the seed in a well-draining potting mix about 1/2 to 1 inch deep and at least 3 inches apart from other seeds. Place the container in a warm, indirect sun location (at least 80 degrees). Cover with a cloche or plastic wrap, keeping the soil moist but not soggy. When the seedling germinates and produces two to three leaves, transplant to a 6-inch pot. Once your plant reaches 6 inches, it is ready for a more permanent home. Potting and Repotting Bird of Paradise Bird of paradise is a rapidly growing plant that needs to reach a certain size before it blooms. A bird of paradise that is 3 to 4 feet tall grows well in a 10-inch pot. A 5- to 6-foot plant usually thrives in a 14-inch pot. Repot it every spring into the next-size-up pot. Once it reaches maturity, allow it to be pot-bound so that it will bloom. You can divide it by the time it has matured or bloomed at least once but do it infrequently since crowded clumps produce the most blooms. Repotting disrupts the bloom cycle. Overwintering If it gets below freezing where you live for a prolonged time, the plant will not survive unless you take it inside for the winter. However, if you live in an area such as Zone 9 where it only dips low for short periods, you may be able to overwinter your plant outdoors, but it will need help to survive. To overwinter outdoors, cut the stem and leaves down to just 12 inches above the ground. Cover the entire stem and rhizome area with a layer of mulch, then leaf litter, and straw. Cover that with breathable row cover material and stake it down. As soon as spring arrives and the threat of the last frost is gone, remove the toppings. Common Pests and Plant Diseases Monitor the plant for aphids, scale, and whiteflies.3 If you see them, use insecticidal soap for control and apply it to the undersides of the leaves. Systemic pesticides are also effective. If you use systemic pesticide, the plant will distribute it from its roots through to its leaves and flowers. Bird of paradise is also susceptible to Botrytis cinerea (gray mold).3 Flowers and leaves with this condition will develop dark spots followed by a layer of gray mold. Remove the affected parts of the plant and allow them to air out. How to Get Bird of Paradise to Bloom Bloom Months A bird of paradise plant is mature enough to bloom when it is at least four to five years old. Typically bloom occurs during March, April, and May. What do Bird of Paradise Flowers Look Like? The plant comes in an array of bloom colors depending on the variety. The most well-known type has a base of blue petals below bold orange petals that resemble the head of a crane. How to Encourage More Blooms To spur flowering, keep the bird of paradise pot-bound, give it lots of sun (at least 6 hours of full sunlight or bright light), and feed it on schedule. Insufficient light is one common reason a bird of paradise fails to flower. Common Problems With Bird of Paradise The bird of paradise is a relatively easy-going plant with very few issues. It is most prone to root rot and insects that prey on the plant when its optimal conditions are unmet. But, if it's not overwatered, kept fed, and given ample light and air circulation—it can keep most problems at bay. Wilting or Browning of Leaves The most common disease affecting the bird of paradise plant is root rot. When the roots of the plant sit in water or the soil gets soggy for a prolonged amount of time, a fungus that causes root rot can overtake a plant. It can be avoided by letting the soil dry out between waterings. Another sign you have root rot includes a rotting smell. Some plants can be saved if caught early. To fix root rot, pull up the root ball, cut away blackened, moldy parts of the rhizome, apply a fungicide according to the instructions, and repot in a sterilized container with fresh, well-draining soil. Curling Leaves Curling leaves are a sign of underwatering. Avoid this problem by giving more water and letting the water run freely from the bottom of the pot to ensure that all the roots have access to water. Make sure the plant doesn't sit in the water because soggy soil can cause other problems. Yellowing Leaves Yellowing leaves can mean several things. An occasional yellow leaf on a mature plant is normal. However, many yellow leaves may signal low humidity or lack of nutrients. If the yellow leaves are located toward the outside of the plant, it needs more water. Slits or Breaks in the Leaves A bird of paradise's leaves are large and may normally develop slits or breaks, especially if your plant lives outside for some part of the year. The plant develops slits to allow the plant to circulate air around its leaves and roots. Wind and breezes contribute to slitting. Air circulation keeps mold and other pests from settling in. FAQ Are bird of paradise easy to care for? Bird of paradise is easy to care for but has a few requirements—like regular feeding and watering. It's one of the easier tropical specimens to grow with relatively few pest problems. How fast does the bird of paradise flower bloom? Bird of paradise is a slow grower, sometimes taking up to five years to mature and flower. How often should I water my bird of paradise plant? Water daily to keep the soil moist during spring and summer but after that cut back watering to once a week so the soil can dry out. Watch for overwatering and check if the soil is draining properly. Too much water can result in root rot and irreversible damage. Explore more: Gardening Houseplants Types of Houseplants Sources More from The Spruce"

How to care for your Bird of Paradise Common Issues for your Bird of Paradise What's a Bird of Paradise? Plant Friends and Family How to care for your Bird of Paradise Use these instructions to care for a Bird of Paradise. This guide will tell you how to water a Bird of Paradise; its light, temperature, humidity preferences and any additional care it might need to help it grow. Bird of Paradise LIGHT The Bird of Paradise can handle direct and bright indirect light. However, it will flourish most in a sunny spot in direct sun. If you don’t think you have a spot with enough light, try using a grow light. WATER Water your Bird of Paradise when the soil volume is 50% dry. Water until liquid flows through the drainage hole at the bottom of the pot and discard any water that has accumulated in the saucer. HUMIDITY The Bird of Paradise prefers a humid environment. Add a pebble tray or a humidifier nearby if you notice crispy leaf edges. TEMPERATURE Average indoor temperatures of 65-80°F are best for the Bird of Paradise. FOOD During spring and summer, fertilize once a month with a general purpose fertilizer. No fertilizer is necessary during the winter when plant growth naturally slows. TOXICITY Bird of Paradise is considered toxic to humans and pets if ingested. ADDITIONAL CARE The Bird of Paradise is sensitive to salt and mineral build-up, so water that’s too hard or soft can cause browning leaf edges. If you notice this, try using rainwater or distilled water. If you notice your plant’s leaves splitting, this is natural. This is to protect their large leaves from snapping from rain and wind. plant image Common Issues for your Bird of Paradise issue image Common Issue Will my Bird of Paradise bloom? issue image Common Issue Why are the leaves on my Bird of Paradise dry and curling?

    "content": "Bird of Paradise Care Contents: Placement Routine Maintenance Recommended Accessories Frequently Asked Questions Pot Information Bird of Paradise Plant Care Placement The Bird of Paradise (Strelitzia nicolai) boasts a stunning display of large tropical leaves that in the wilds of southern Africa can reach up to 20' tall! In human spaces, they're more likely to stand anywhere from 3’- 8’ tall, but still rank among most houseplant fans' favorites due to the remarkable size of their rich foliage. Choose a location for your Bird of Paradise away from air vents and drafts where the plant will get at least four hours of southern, western, or eastern exposure. Though they can tolerate medium light conditions, the Bird of Paradise will not thrive long-term without adequate sunlight, so we always recommend placing them in bright light. If you are unsure about lighting conditions in your home or office, we have a guide for how to measure light in your space. Bird of Paradise Plant Leaf Bird of Paradise plants are often confused with banana plants, but while bananas have a spiral leaf growth pattern, Bird of Paradise plants have an alternate leaf growth pattern. Routine Maintenance Always be sure to assess your plant’s watering needs upon receiving it. Before giving your plant a drink, it is best to check the moisture level in the soil first to ensure it isn’t moist right beneath the surface. A soil probe is a very handy tool for both checking the soil moisture deep within a planter and can also be used to aerate overly wet soil. Birds of Paradise enjoy moist (but not soggy) soil, and being allowed to dry out slightly between waterings. Try not to let the soil dry completely through the pot, but also avoid overwatering. Allow the top 2\" - 3\" of the soil to become dry between waterings, but below that should remain moist. These plants do particularly well in our self watering containers. The splits in the leaves of the Bird of Paradise are natural, and allow light to access the lower portion of the plant. Keep your plant away from drafts, and apply extra humidity with a humidifier, pebble tray, or mister to keep the splitting to a minimum. Rotate your plant periodically to ensure even growth on all sides and don't be afraid to prune discolored or broken leaves. It is important to dust the leaves of Bird of Paradise plants often so the plant can photosynthesize efficiently. To dust, use a mister and microfiber cloth to throughly wipe down each leaf and take the opportunity to inspect the undersides of the foliage to keep an eye out for pests. Note if you are using a container made from organic materials to pot your Bird of Paradise in, we highly recommend using a waterproof saucer underneath to protect your floors, as humidity may accumulate beneath the pot and can damage wood floors and carpeting. Remember each plant is a unique living thing and may have varying needs, especially in their individual locations. Pay attention to the condition of your Bird of Paradise and its watering needs and you will have a long and happy relationship. Frequently Asked Questions Why are the leaves of my Bird of Paradise splitting? Why are my bird of paradise leaves splitting? A Bird of Paradise living free and in the wild in front of an apartment complex in Florida. Splitting leaves on the Bird of Paradise is totally normal and natural. The splits are an evolutionary adaptation of the plant that allow wind to pass through the leaves, meaning the leaves themselves don't function as giant sails. Over time, older leaves develop more splits and can be pruned as new leaves emerge and fill out the plant. If you notice the plant is developing splits rapidly, check that it is removed from air vents and drafts, and that it is receiving adequate light and water. Increasing the humidity around your plant with a humidifier or frequent misting can help prevent and slow leaf splitting. Will my Bird of Paradise flower? Most often, Bird of Paradise will not produce flowers indoors. Only in their natural habitat of high humidity and high light conditions will the circumstances be right for them to flower. The variety Greenery Unlimited offers is the white flowering giant Bird of Paradise, as the leaves are much larger and more impressive than those of the orange flowering variety, which flower more commonly. What is this spear emerging from the middle of my plant? A new leaf! New leaves always come from the center of the plant and shoot out in a tightly wound spear. Over the course of a few weeks the leaf will slowly uncurl and reveal a brilliant, shiny, bright green new leaf. Although tempting, do not assist the leaf to open as this can damage the leaf. If the leaf seems stuck in spots and is splitting, you may want to try to increase the humidity around the plant and mist the emerging leaf. How can I tell if my Bird of Paradise is getting enough light? Bird of Paradise love lots of bright indirect light, and some direct light too. Some symptoms of the plant suffering from lack of light are extreme leaf splitting, drooping leaves, new leaves that won't open, and leaf browning. You may also find the plant has difficulty with water absorption through the roots and therefore will suffer from overwatering more easily if it is not receiving enough light.

LEFT: An example of a Bird of Paradise drooping, browning, and splitting due to lack of light. RIGHT: A brown curled leaf the Bird of Paradise plant. This kind of browning is similar to severely under-watered plants, but in this case it is from lack of light. How often should I fertilize my plant? In general, houseplants will thrive when they are fertilized spring through fall. Fertilize once a month with an organic houseplant fertilizer, following the package instructions for dilution and administration. Greenery Unlimited uses an organic potting mix with a slow release fertilizer in the soil, so should you purchase your plant from us you will not need fertilizer within the first 6 months of receiving it. How can I tell if my Bird of Paradise is being overwatered? In proper lighting conditions, the Bird of Paradise drinks plenty of water. Although it does require a drying out period and is susceptible to root rot if the soil remains overly moist. If your plant is not receiving enough light, it is more susceptible to overwatering. Some indications that your plant could be overwatered are droopy leaves, excessive splitting, and browning edged leaves with a yellow line. If you think you may have overwatered, a soil probe can help you assess how we the soil is at the root level and aerate the soil to release excess moisture. One great way to help prevent overwatering is to plant your Bird of Paradise with aeration stones at the bottom of the planter. Proper drainage is essential for long-term root health and aeration stones can absorb excess water at the base of the planter helping to ensure your roots are never in standing water.

Note the browning is on the outer most edge preceded by a thin line of yellowing on the interior of the leaf. How can I tell if my Bird of Paradise is not getting enough water? Underwatering most commonly presents as dry crispy tips or edges on the leaves, leaf splitting or breaking with brittle edges, and brown shriveled basal leaves. Underwatering is easy to bounce back from, so determine if the quantity or frequency should be increased to help nurse your plant back to health.

LEFT: An example of a Bird of Paradise leaf tips curling and browning due to lack of water. RIGHT: Shriveled, curled, and browning crispy basal leaves as seen in this photo are a clear indication that the plant is thirsty. . How often should I repot my plant? For larger floor plants, we suggest repotting every 18-24 months — although the Bird of Paradise prefers to be slightly pot bound, so you can hold off on repotting for 28 months if the plant is in healthy condition. Typically you want to choose a potting vessel 2”- 4” larger in diameter to allow for growth. If you prefer to maintain the current size of your plant, repot it into the same vessel, providing new soil and trimming away some roots and foliage. Spring or summer is the ideal time for repotting as the plant is at its strongest. Recommended Pots The Bird of Paradise plant develops thick, tuberous roots that can fill up the empty space in a pot relatively quickly. Plants grown in their nursery pots will generally take up the entire pot, so it's always important to buy a container with a larger interior diameter than the size of the grow pot. We find the Bird of Paradise looks best in either low planters that show off its foliage, or higher tapered planters that show off its height. Almost all of our large planters feature removable drain plugs with optional matching plant saucers as well. Calyer 34 Wythe 30 Wythe 40 Newel 30 Standard Planter Instructions Planting instructions for a standard planter with drainage. All of our Standard Planters include a removable drainage plug to give our customers the option of drainage. While no drainage is sometimes preferred for its aesthetic simplicity, we don't recommend this option for beginners as watering mistakes can be hard to rectify. Whether you choose to use drainage or not, we always recommend using a layer of drainage (such as our Aeration Stones) at the base of the planter. A drainage layer allows the plant's roots access to oxygen in the pockets between the drainage medium, and a lack of drainage can cause anaerobic damage to your plant. If you decide to utilize the drainage hole for your pot, make sure to include a Plant Saucer beneath your pot to collect excess water. For most plants in standard planters, we recommend watering about once a week. Water the soil mass until water begins pooling in your Plant Saucer. With no drainage hole, you will need to be more precise in your watering. While we would love to give you a specific measurement of water to provide for your plant, the reality is that a plant's water requirements vary wildly depending on factors such as light exposure and the overall health of the plant. You will need to learn to tell when the plant is thirsty based on how its foliage looks. Droopy foliage is usually the first sign: when your plant looks a little slumped over that's usually a visual indicator that it's thirsty. The best solution for checking your plant's moisture level, drainage hole of not, is to use a Soil Probe to determine the moisture content of the soil at the bottom of the planter. Self Watering Planter Instructions planting instructions for a Self Watering (or sub-irrigated) Container. The Self-Watering Planters require a deep and thorough watering of the topsoil after they are first planted. This is important because the roots of the plants first need to grow into the reservoir in order to drink from it. Water your plant from the top for two to four weeks before using the reservoir. During the dormant seasons, or for plants that have slower growing habits, consider top watering for longer. TEST: After the initial top water period, fill the bottom water reservoir. If the water in the reservoir is absorbed into the planter, it means the plant is ready for regular reservoir servicing. If not, be sure to continue top watering for a few more weeks until the plant has started drinking from the reservoir. RESERVOIR SERVICING: Once the reservoir empties on its own, do not refill the reservoir right away. Similar to how humans need a breath of air between gulps of water, most plants require a drying out period. Allow for the reservoir to empty all the way between watering. All plants are different in their needs so the amount of time the reservoir sits empty will need to be determined, but know that for most plants this period is between 1-3 days. From here on out, you should rarely topwater the plant while using the reservoir system. Watering from below allows the plant to drink at its own pace, and can help combat certain issues like fungus gnats by allowing the top layer of soil to dry out more. Please note that if your plant's soil dries out too much, it can impair the wicking ability of the Aeration Stones in your planter. If your soil becomes too dry, we recommend giving it a thorough watering.

These Central and South American natives feature pointed, ovate leaves in a variety of combinations of green, cream, and white colors, and they can reach 10 feet tall. Note that these plants are toxic to people and pets.1 Common Names Dieffenbachia, dumb cane Botanical Name Dieffenbachia spp. Family Araceae Plant Type Herbaceous, perennial Mature Size 3–10 ft. tall, 2–3 ft. wide Sun Exposure Partial Soil Type Well-drained Soil pH Acidic Bloom Time Spring, summer Flower Color White Hardiness Zones 10–12 (USDA) Native Area Caribbean, South America Toxicity Toxic to people, pets2 Dieffenbachia Care Dieffenbachia has really basic care needs. Place dieffenbachia in bright, indirect sunlight, away from full sun exposure. Use a fertile, well-draining potting soil with a high peat or coco coir content. Water when the soil begins to dry out. Average household temperatures and humidity should be fine, though it would prefer a slightly higher humidity if possible (a bright bathroom, for example). dumb cane plant Credit: The Spruce / Krystal Slagle closeup of dumb cane leaves closeup shot of a dumb cane plant Where to Put Dieffenbachia When grown as a houseplant, put dieffenbachia in a well lit, naturally humid area, like a bathroom or kitchen with a few windows. Place it in or near a window. If the window is south- or west-facing, you'll want a sheer curtain between the window and the plant. If you're growing dieffenbachia outdoors, plant it in a spot that gets dappled light but would be considered a shady spot. When planting multiple dieffenbachia, give them a few feet of space between each. Light Place dieffenbachia plants in bright, indirect light. They will favor the side facing the light, so periodically rotate the plant to keep its growth balanced. Soil Use a fast-draining, well-aerated potting mix. Make sure drainage is good to avoid damaging the roots; they should never be left in soggy soil. Water During the growing season, dieffenbachias like regular moisture and do not want to dry out, so water whenever the top couple inches of soil are dry. A large dieffenbachia might need to be watered twice a week. In the winter, you can cut back on the water. At the same time, it's important not to overwater a dieffenbachia, which can cause rot problems. Keep the Soil Moist Use a moisture meter to evaluate the soil, and water just before it becomes dry. This will provide consistent moisture without flooding the roots. Temperature and Humidity This plant likes fairly warm conditions, from 65°F to 75°F. If the temperature drops below 60°F or if the plant is exposed to cold drafts, it is likely to lose lower leaves and assume a palm-like appearance. The plant appreciates high humidity, but average household humidity should be fine. Fertilizer For best results, feed regularly (every four to six weeks) with a balanced, diluted fertilizer, such as a 20-20-20. For the amount to use, follow product label instructions. However, some growers swear by a routine of using a weak diluted fertilizer at every watering. Types of Dieffenbachia The Dieffenbachia genus includes a large group of beautiful tropical perennials, but the ones most commonly grown in cultivation are D. sequine, D. oerstedii, D. maculata, and D. amoena. Further, cultivars are available of these species. D. seguine, the most popular Dieffenbachia species, is a native of Brazil with clusters of large ovate leaves with green margins splotched with yellow or cream color. It can grow as tall as 10 feet. D. maculata (formerly known as D. picta) offers good cultivars that include 'Perfection,' with intensely variegated 8-inch leaves; 'Rudolph Roehrs,' with fully yellow leaves with ivory splotches; and 'Superba,' with thicker leaves and white variegation. D. maculata 'Camille' has pale yellow leaves with white margins and grows to about 3 feet. D. amoena is a large, 6-foot plant with 20-inch leaves. One notable cultivar is 'Tropic Snow,' which has smaller leaves and more variegation. Dieffenbachia 'Carina' has medium green leaves with darker green edges. Dieffenbachia 'Compacta' is smaller and has green, heavily speckled leaves. Is this the right plant for you? A dieffenbachia is a good plant for you if: You want a plant with a medium growth rate that won't get big quickly. You want an easy plant to care for that isn't too picky about conditions. You want a plant with big, sculptural leaves. Pruning A dieffenbachia plant usually requires pruning when it's too tall and there seem to be few leaves on the lower part of the stem. With a sterilized, sharp cutting tool, prune the plant so that about a foot of stem remains to trigger new growth. You can also remove dead, yellowing leaves from the bottom, if desired. Pruning Tip Looking for the best pruners for your dieffenbachia plant? We tested top-rated pruners in our Lab to make sure your plant stays happy and healthy. Propagating Dieffenbachia Dieffenbachia is easy to propagate. The best methods are via root division, from a stump, and from cane cuttings. Root Division Unpot the plant. Gently remove the plant from its pot and identify the offsets. (The offsets are the little stems that grew out from the central stem). Separate the offsets. Use a clean tool to cut the offset off the central stem. Make sure not to damage the root system of either stem. Plant in soil. Plant each offset in a pot filled with fast-draining potting mix and water well. If the offset has no roots, you can propagate it in water until it grows roots that are a few inches long, then transfer it to soil. Stump Propagation This works best on older, leggier dieffenbachias In older, leggy dieffenbachias. Cut the top of the plant. You want the cutting to be at least 4 or 5 inches, with several inches of bare stem on the bottom half. Dip in rooting hormone. Dip the cut end in a rooting hormone to aid with the process of root development. Plant in soil. Plant in a pot with fast-draining potting mix. The bottom few inches of stem should be below the soil. New leaves will sprout from the stump. Remove older leaves. Once new leaves appear, remove the older leaves. Cuttings Cut pieces of the stem. Each piece should be a few inches long. Lay stems in soil. Lay them horizontally in damp potting soil. Keep soil moist. As the pieces take root, leaves will gradually sprout from the sides of the stem. Repot. Move each rooted piece to its own pot filled with fresh potting mix. Potting and Repotting Dieffenbachia Dieffenbachias often need annual replanting. Watch out for signs of stress on the plant, such as roots poking out from the soil surface or through the drainage holes, crowding, or falling leaves, which could signal that the plant needs repotting. To repot, simply lift the plant out of its container by the base. Knock away any old soil and dead material from the roots, and place it in a larger container (about 1 to 2 inches larger in diameter) with some added fresh soil. After repotting a dieffenbachia, give it some time to adjust to its new setting. Wear gloves to avoid contact with the sap.1 Overwintering Bring a potted dieffenbachia plant indoors during cooler months and keep it in a bright spot where the temperature will stay above 60°F. Water the plant once a week as it won't need as much water as in the summertime. Common Pests Dieffenbachia plants are largely trouble-free, but like many indoor plants, they can be susceptible to spider mites, especially indoor plants that are placed in dry air. These pests can be treated with a horticultural oil along with added humidity. Common Problems With Dieffenbachia You will be able to tell a lot about your dieffenbachia by the state of its leaves. Watch for certain colorations on the leaves to let you know what to do to amend conditions. Yellowing or Browning Leaves Overwatering or underwatering your plant can turn the leaves yellow and then brown. Often, they will also fall off the plant. Check the soil by sticking a finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If it's wet, hold off on watering for a week or so. Leaves could also turn yellow because the plant is lacking nutrients, such as nitrogen. Though this can be tough to diagnose, it won't hurt to use a plant fertilizer to see if will bring your plant back to health. Drooping Leaves Dieffenbachia prefers partial shade. If your plant droops, it may mean it's getting too much sunlight. Move the plant to a spot with indirect sunlight. However, if it's not getting enough light, the leaves may turn yellow and droop. Move it to an area with a bit more light to alleviate this problem. The plant may droop because it is cold or near a draft. Keep your plant in a consistently warm area that's between 65°F to 75°F. Not Growing If your dieffenbachia isn't growing at all, first consider the time of year. In the winter, you're unlikely to get much growth. In spring, summer, and even fall, you can expect new leaves to be unfurling regularly. Move your dieffenbachia to a spot that gets more bright, indirect light and increase watering to account for the increase in light. Adding fertilizer will not help a plant grow new leaves. Fertilizer supports plant growth; it doesn't initiate plant growth.

Dieffenbachia is a rather easy plant to grow indoors, but the best results require the right lighting and the right watering schedule. Where is the best place to put dieffenbachia indoors? The best place to put a dieffenbachia indoors is in an east- or west-facing window. Dieffenbachia plants like bright, indirect light. What does an overwatered dieffenbachia look like? Overwatered dieffenbachia will have yellow leaves that fall off and may have a slimy residue near the base. The stem could even be soft and squishy, in cases of severe overwatering. What is the toxicity level of dieffenbachia? Dieffenbachia is highly toxic when ingested by humans and animals, including dogs, cats, and livestock.1 Is dieffenbachia a good houseplant? Yes, dieffenbachia is a great houseplant. It's low maintenance and adaptable to various lighting conditions. It's available in many varieties and cultivars. Do dieffenbachia like sun or shade? Dieffenbachia prefer a spot that gets sun, but not strong direct sun. Ideally it has a sheer curtain between it and any direct sun if it's in a south- or west-facing window. It can sit directly in an east- or north-facing window. Explore more: Gardening Houseplants Types of Houseplants Sources More from The Spruce"

Plant Size: Height: 1.5 Spread: 100 Dieffenbachias, also known as leopard lilies, are striking house plants grown for their large, oval leaves that are splashed or flecked with white, cream, yellow or lime green. They bring a lush look to a room and are good air purifiers. Ad Dieffenbachia is also known as the dumb cane thanks to its sap which, if ingested, can cause temporary swelling of the mouth and throat, making speaking difficult. It's therefore a good idea to keep your plant away from children and pets. Wear gloves when handling, or wash your hands afterwards. The 'cane' part of the name is derived from the fact that, in the rainforests of central and south America, where it grows naturally, the foliage tends to grow at the top, towards the light. In your home, new leaves will unfurl from the top of the central stem. Their native habitat of dieffenbachias gives plenty of clues about their care – they need warmth, humidity and bright, dappled light. Ad Planting perennials in autumn The exact names of the varieties can be confusing and have recently changed, but the most common types that you're likely to find for sale are varieties of Dieffenbachia seguine, Dieffenbachia amoena and Dieffenbachia maculata. How to grow dieffenbachia Dieffenbachia do best in bright, indirect light but can tolerate light shade. Keep out of direct sun. Water when the soil starts to become slightly dry at the top. Dieffenbachia thrives in warm temperatures, ideally 18-24°C. Avoid draughts and fluctuating temperatures. Mist regularly, or keep on a tray of moist pebbles.

A good time to do this is when you repot in spring. Simply pull the plant apart gently, making sure each piece has some roots, and plant each new plant in its own pot. Growing dieffenbachia: common problems Pale, washed out leaves and poor growth could be due to low light levels – move your plant to a brighter spot. Dropping lower leaves, wilting, curling or yellowing leaves could be due to low temperatures – move your plant to a warmer spot. Direct sunlight will scorch the leaves, creating brown patches. Drooping leaves can be caused by under or overwatering, so check your watering regime and adjust accordingly. Crinkly or crispy leaves could be due to lack of water. Brown edges or tips could be due to compost or air that is too dry, or uneven watering. You might have also given your plant too much fertiliser. It's normal for a dieffenbachia to become tall and leggy over time, losing its lower leaves. You can simply cut the plant down to its desired height - it should resprout from the point where it was cut. You can also then replant the crown into its own pot, which should root and form a new plant. Alternatively, cut the plant down to around 10cm tall and wait for it to resprout. Mealybugs can be a problem on dieffenbachia – look out for insects that look like white, fluffy blobs on the undersides of leaves. Wipe them off with a damp cloth or cotton bud that has been soaked in an insecticide that contains fatty acids or plant oils. If the leaves and stems of your plant are covered in fine webbing, this could be spider mites. The upper surface of the leaf may be mottled, while mites and eggs can be seen with a magnifying glass on the undersides of leaves. Improve air circulation around the plant and boost humidity by misting or standing on a tray of moist pebbles. Treat with a spray containing fatty acid or plant oils. Raised brown spots on the leaves could be scale insect. Wipe them off with a damp cloth or cotton bud that has been soaked in an insecticide that contains fatty acids or plant oils. Ad Advice on buying dieffenbachia Bear in mind that the sap is toxic if ingested, so this is not a plant to choose if you have children or pets You can buy dieffenbachia at the garden centre, but for the best selection of varieties, visit a specialist house plant retailer or buy online Look for a lush, healthy plant with upright, brightly coloured leaves and no signs of pests or diseases Where to buy dieffenbachia online Primrose Crocus Bloom Box Club Varieties of dieffenbachia to grow Dieffenbachia 'Camilla' - lush, apple green leaves with a creamy white splash in the centre.

With its distinguishing green and white foliage, Dieffenbachia is not only decorative but highly tolerant of imperfect conditions, making this one of the easiest plants to care for. As you'll see Dieffenbachia care may be simple but yields excellent results. How to care for your Dieffenbachia Common Issues for your Dieffenbachia What's a Dieffenbachia? Plant Friends and Family How to care for your Dieffenbachia Use these instructions to care for a Dieffenbachia. This guide will tell you how to water a Dieffenbachia; its light, temperature, humidity preferences and any additional care it might need to help it grow. Dieffenbachia LIGHT The Dieffenbachia thrives the most under bright, indirect sunlight. So avoiding direct exposure to the sun is vital to protecting the leaves from burn. You can place a Dieffenbachia in a slightly dimmer area, but the plant’s growth will slow down. Hence, a grow light might help achieve optimal growth and vibrancy. WATER When establishing your Dieffenbachia care routine, consider checking the soil’s level of dryness. If 50 to 75% of it feels dry, then water your plant thoroughly until the liquid pours out of the drainage holes on the bottom of the pot. Refrain from leaving water standing in the saucer. Another rule of thumb, especially for larger plants, is to water two times per week, but avoid saturating the soil too much to avoid root rotting or fungal growth. Also, you can water less frequently during the winter, which is Dieffenbachia’s dormant season. HUMIDITY While average household humidity works fine for the Dieffenbachia, it tends to thrive with a nominal amount of moisture in the air. You can provide extra humidity by placing its pot on top of a tray of pebbles and water or by misting the leaves periodically to prevent browning. A humidifier also works well, but you won’t have to turn it on frequently unless the air becomes dry during the winter months. TEMPERATURE Temperatures between 65-75°F are ideal for the Dieffenbachia. And because it loves warm temperatures and high humidity, you might keep the plant away from drafts, doorways, and vents. FOOD Monthly feedings are a part of optimal Dieffenbachia care, particularly during the spring and summer months. You can use a 20-20-20 fertilizer measured at half strength and diluted water. An important tip to remember is to apply the fertilizer to damp soil only. TOXICITY You’ll need to place your Dieffenbachia out of reach of pets and small children since it’s toxic when ingested. ADDITIONAL CARE If you notice the tips or edges of your plant’s leaves are turning brown, it could be due to your tap water. You can prevent this by watering with filtered water or rainwater. Remove any yellow leaves to keep your plant strong and growing. plant image Common Issues for your Dieffenbachia issue image Common Issue Why are the leaves on my Dieffenbachia yellowing? issue image Common Issue Why is my Dieffenbachia leggy?

Rex begonia grows at a moderate pace, reaching maturity of 8 to 12 inches within a few years. This semi-tropical perennial plant does best with bright, indirect light and does not tolerate full sunlight. It likes moisture but should dry out partially between waterings. Rex begonia is an extremely easy houseplant to care for, however, take care if you have animals as this plant is toxic to both people and pets.12 Common Name Rex begonia Botanical Name Begonia rex-cultorum Family Begoniaceae Plant Type Herbaceous, perennial Mature Size 12-18 in. tall, similar spread Sun Exposure Partial, shade Soil Type Well drained Soil pH Acidic Hardiness Zones 10-12 (USDA) Native Area Asia Toxicity Toxic to people, pets12 Rex Begonia Care Here are the main care requirements for growing rex begonia: Provide rex begonias with plenty of bright, indirect sun, but keep them out of direct sunlight. Keep the plant moist, but avoid overwatering; allow the soil to dry partially between waterings. Place the plant in an area with temperatures between 60°F and 70°F. Use a porous potting mix in a relatively shallow pot. Feed the plant regularly. As a houseplant, rotate frequently to expose it to equal light on all sides. closeup of a rex begonia Credit: The Spruce / Krystal Slagle iron cross begonia Light Rex begonias need less light than other plants in the begonia family. Keep your Rex begonia in a spot that receives bright, indirect light year-round. If you're growing indoors and can't provide the proper lighting, Rex begonias also thrive under fluorescent lights. Soil For best results, a light, airy, fast-draining soil will keep your Rex begonia thriving. These begonias have fine root systems, so they prefer well-aerated, peat-based potting soil. Water Rex begonias require regular water, but don't overwater them. The soil should feel slightly, yet evenly moist. Allow the soil surface to become dry to the touch before watering. Don't let the soil become overly dry or the plant will begin to wither. The plants thrive on humidity but don’t let the leaves get wet, or you risk powdery mildew. Temperature and Humidity Rex begonias do best in moderate temperatures (60°F to 70°F) and moderately high humidity (around 50 percent). Growth will slow in freezing temperatures and some types of begonias go into a dormant period during the winter due to lack of light.3 As with other begonias, rex and other begonias grown at home prefer the same humid, gentle environment in which understory ferns thrive. Fertilizer Use liquid fertilizer at half strength every two weeks during growing season.

The resulting hybrids are often known in the trade only by fancy trade names used to market the plants. As a result, you might find that the same crosses have different names in different garden centers. Recent hybrid cultivars include: Begonia ‘Avatar’: This hybrid cultivar bred by Byron Martin has silvery pale green leaves touched with light purple and pink accents, and deep purple veining in its frilly-edged leaves. Begonia ‘China Curl’: The large tear-drop shaped leaves have spiral variegation patterns that alternate deep purple black and pale silver-green. Begonia ‘Curly Fireflush’: This richly-colored heirloom has pale yellow-green leaves edged with deep burgundy, with a pale lilac flush at the center. Originally called 'Bettina Rothschild' when introduced in 1866. Begonia ‘Emerald Wave’: This hybrid has dramatic spiraling leaves of emerald green and deep plum purple. Begonia ‘Fireworks’: A compact plant with a striking appearance, this hybrid has silver heart shaped leaves with dark red veining and pale plum edges. Begonia ‘Froggy’: The small white flowers are a delicate accent to the subtle yet stunning coloring of olive green leaves with black accents that invoke spiderwebs or stained glass. Tips for Buying in Store Check for pests. Signs include spots on the leaves, flying insects in the soil, and webbing on the underside of the leaves. Inspect the roots. Make sure they aren't dense and in a large clump, and that there aren't too many roots coming out of the drainage holes. Check to ensure the roots look healthy and aren't soggy and brown. Read the plant label. Be sure you understand the care requirements and have a good spot for the plant in your home. Propagating Rex Begonias Rex begonias can be propagated in water, by cuttings, or by division. Rhizomatous begonias such as the rex begonia can be easily propagated by rhizome division, layering, or leaf-tip cuttings. New growth takes about six weeks to emerge. Propagating Tip No pruners? No problem! We've tested the top-rated pruners to help you choose the right one for your comfort and personal needs—there's an option for everyone. Division Lift the rex begonia out of its pot in the springtime. Gently prod the dirt with a clean pair of scissors between the stalks to begin encouraging the rhizomes to pull apart, trying to untangle them naturally and without too much force. Replant the divided stalks with roots into their own pots. Keep the repotted begonia and the potted divisions consistently moist (not soggy) and out of direct sunlight for the next couple of weeks to help them rebound from the stress. Water Propagation Use a sharp, sanitized cutting tool to take off a leaf from the mother plant. Make the cut where the petiole (the stalk that attaches the leaf to the stem) meets the stem. Gently trim the base of the petiole to clean up jagged edges. Use a small paintbrush to lightly add rooting hormone to the bottom of the petiole. Use a stick to make a small hole in the soil for the petiole. Insert the petiole so that only the petiole, not the leaf, is in the soil. Put the cutting in a location that is out of direct sunlight. Put a plastic bag over the pot (without touching the leaf) to make a mini greenhouse and keep the soil moist. Check soil every few days; water if dry. Check for rooting in six weeks, after which you can remove the bag and bring the pot into a spot with more light. Leaf Cuttings Lift the rex begonia out of its pot in the springtime. Gently prod the dirt between the stalks with a clean pair of pruners to begin encouraging the rhizomes to pull apart, trying to untangle them without too much force. Replant the divided stalks with roots into their own pots. Keep the repotted begonia and the potted divisions consistently moist (not soggy) and out of direct sunlight for the next couple of weeks to help them rebound from the stress. Tip The vast majority of begonias offered in the trade are hybrids, so they cannot be accurately propagated from seed. You won’t grow the same plant as the parent plant. Potting and Repotting Rex begonias are rhizomatous plants that grow from a shallow and knobby rhizome. As such, they do best in large, relatively shallow pots where the rhizome has room to spread. If the rhizome still has room to grow in its pot, the begonia should be considered happily potted. When the rhizome begins to butt up against the sides of the pot, however, it's time to repot into a fresh pot with fresh soil. Divide the rhizome when repotting to increase your plant stock. As with all begonias, don't soak the soil of newly potted plants, but do keep it lightly moist and warm. Get Your Repotting Gear The Best Potting Soils for the Job The Best Indoor Planters We've Found for You The Best Gardening Gloves, Tested and Reviewed Common Pests and Diseases Mealybugs can be an issue for rex begonia plants.4 To prevent the pests, keep the plant well-trimmed and remove dead leaves from the surface of the planting mix. Rex begonias are often troubled by powdery mildew and botrytis fungal disease. A systemic fungicide can help with both issues.5 Remove dead leaves promptly and provide good air circulation. Common Problems With Rex Begonias Wilting Leaves or Leaf Loss Wilting leaves or leaf loss on a rex begonia can be caused by pests; soil that is too wet or too dry; too little light; or low humidity. Assess the plant’s conditions and adjust accordingly to better meet its preferred conditions. Soft Leaves If rex begonia leaves lack substance or feel mushy or soft, the issue may be overwatering or under-watering. It's tricky to get this balance right, but a good rule of thumb is to check the top inch of soil before watering, and only water when it feels dry. Water deeply and let excess water drain out. Water shouldn’t stand on the surface of the soil; if it is, repotting and replacing the soil may help. Is this the right plant for you? A REX BEGONIA IS A GOOD CHOICE IF: You have a sunny spot in your yard where this plant could thrive. You want a plant that can be grown outdoors or indoors as a houseplant. You want a plant that's easy to propagate so you can get more bang for your buck. Plants That Look Great With Rex Begonias Nerve plant: Nerve plants look great with rex begonia. Both nerve plants and rex begonias tend to be shades of green, white, and red or pink, so they pair nicely. Calathea: Calathea and rex begonia leaves usually feature one color around the perimeter and then a solid color or pattern on the rest of the leaf. The larger, smoother leaves of the calathea contrast well with the smaller, textured leaves of a rex begonia. Rattlesnake plant: With its spear-shaped, rippled, striped leaves, the rattlesnake plant offers some real height and size next to a rex begonia, which tends to stay more compact. FAQ Can rex begonias be grown indoors? Rex begonias can be grown indoors. They are an easy-care houseplant if you can give them their preferred conditions (bright, indirect light and moist soil). Do rex begonias prefer shade? No, rex begonias do not prefer shade; they like bright but indirect light. They will do fine in partial shade conditions, but offer too little light and they may go into dormancy. Do rex begonias like to be rootbound? Unlike many houseplants, rex begonias do like to be slightly root-bound, so it's important when repotting not to choose too large a pot and to keep the roots nestled closely. Is rex begonia a perennial or annual? As a houseplant you can grow rex begonia for years and years as a perennial. Outdoors, rex begonias are sensitive to cold temperatures and will grow as annuals in most of the United States and perennials in tropical or semi-tropical regions. What's the difference between a begonia and a rex begonia? Begonias are perennial plants grown for their flowers, whereas rex begonias are annual plants grown for their foliage, though they're more commonly kept as perennial houseplants."

Native to the warm Mediterranean region, rosemary is hardy in USDA zones 7-10, occasionally even into zone 6. With the proper light, water, temperature, soil, and fertilizer, rosemary has been known to live as long as 30 years. Light Rosemary should be grown in full sun; at least 6 hours of direct sun. If growing it indoors, rosemary needs a south-facing window and often supplemental grow lights. Water Rosemary prefers its soil on the dry side. It should be watered every week and a half to two weeks in the ground and once a week if it is container-grown. Before watering, check the top inch (2.5 cm) of soil with your finger. If it is dry to the touch, water the herb. Temperature & Humidity Rosemary likes warm temperatures with moderate humidity. While most varieties tolerate high temperatures, they prefer a range of 55-80 F (13-27 C). Most varieties will die at temperatures below freezing. Soil Most cultivars of rosemary thrive in well-draining, slightly acidic, loamy soil with a pH of 6.0-7.0. Fertilizer Generally, rosemary grown in the ground will not need fertilizer however, even they will benefit from light fertilization. Feed them with a slow-release fertilizer for shrubs and trees or an organic fertilizer in the late winter or early spring. Sap-sucking pests are attracted to plants that have had too much nitrogen fertilizer applied. Pests & Diseases Rosemary is quite resistant to pests however, spider mites, mealy bugs or scales may attack the plant. A good spray of water or insecticidal soap can remove the majority of sap-sucking insects. Scales can easily be removed by pruning the tips of the plant where these sedentary pests are found. Overwatering encourages root rots. The entire plant will become limp and its terminal shoots die off. Dig up the plant and prune out infected roots then dust with fungicide powder. If the root system is black and mushy, throw the plant away. How to Plant Rosemary Rosemary can be planted in the garden proper or grown as a container plant either indoors or outside. It can be grown in dry to medium soil that is well-draining, in full sun although it will tolerate light shade. Heavy clay soil should be avoided. Growing Rosemary in Pots Rosemary is often grown in containers, especially in areas where it's considered an annual. Containers should have adequate drainage holes. The potted rosemary can be grown outside until temperatures begin to drop in the fall and then brought indoors and placed in a sunny southern window that provides at least 6 hours per day of full sun. Supplemental light may be needed in the form of grow lights. Plants in pots generally need more frequent irrigation than those grown in the ground and this is true of rosemary when it is outside. However, avoid overwatering which can foster fungal diseases. Only water when the top inch (2.5 cm) of soil feels dry to the touch. Take overwintered rosemary outside again in the mid-spring when temps have warmed and all danger of frost has passed. Repotting Rosemary should be repotted each year in the spring. Remove the plant from its container, loosen the roots gently, and place it at the same depth in a new pot that is one size up from the last, then fill in around the plant with fresh potting medium. Overwintering Rosemary should be moved if it is in an area that gets freezing temperatures. If it is container grown, the plant can be moved inside and cared for much as a houseplant or, it can go in a protected garage or shed and be allowed to go dormant until spring. Plants that remain in the ground can be covered with burlap bags or chicken wire enclosures filled with dry leaves to protect them from the cold. It is also best to situate plants on the south or west side of the house so they can benefit from the protection of the foundation. Also protect the roots of the plants by covering them with 5-6 inches (13-15 cm) of wood chips. Pruning Rosemary To get a bushier plant, prune rosemary after it blooms to encourage new growth. Since this is a woody herb, always use very sharp, sterile pruning shears to make your cuts. Rosemary may be pruned at any time during the spring or summer; up until 4-6 weeks prior to the first frost for your area. Do not prune the plant after this point as pruning facilitates new growth which could then freeze and harm the plant. Rosemary plants can be pruned into topiaries, but never remove more than 1/3rd of the foliage at any one time. Doing so can kill the plant. Propagation Rosemary can be grown from seed although germination rates are low and it takes some time (up to three years) for the herb to grow large enough to harvest from. Otherwise, propagation is more commonly done through cuttings. Cuttings should be taken from mature plants. With a sharp, sterile knife or pruning shear, cut a 4-6 inch cutting in the late spring to early summer. Be sure your cutting is not blooming. Remove the lower leaves from the cutting and place it immediately into a room temperature glass of water. In warmer temperatures, roots should grow within a few weeks; longer if it's colder. When the roots are half an inch long, its time to transplant them into a well-draining, sandy soil medium and place them in a sunny area. Rosemary Varieties There are many varieties of rosemary, some upright and some prostrate in habit. Their blooms may be blue, pink or white, and some cultivars are more hardy than others. Some of the more common cultivars include Albus, Arp, Collingwood Ingram, Creeping, Gorzia, Lockwood de Forest, Majorca Pink, Officinalis, Salem, Spice Island or Tuscan Blue. Companion Plants for Rosemary Rosemary is a good companion plant for most herbs such as basil, sage, thyme and oregano. It also makes a good companion plant for bloomers such as sunflowers, marigolds, and nasturtiums and settles in nicely with root veggies like carrots. Rosemary Plant Uses & Benefits In the garden, rosemary is suited for use in rock, winter, edible, cutting, pollinator, butterfly, childrens and other gardens. It does well in containers or as a border or low hedge as well as areas where it can trail. Leaves can be used either fresh or dried in a variety of menus from steaks to stews to breads, herbal butters or vinegars. The flowers and leaves are used in sachets and potpourri and the oil is pressed for use in a variety of cosmetics and toiletries. It has a long history of use medicinally. It is said to be antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant. It is also purported to aid in alleviating pain, improving memory, promoting hair growth, and improving circulation. Rosemary is also a good plant for areas with deer as they avoid the plant. Frequently Asked Questions Is Rosemary a Perennial? Rosemary is a perennial in USDA zones 7-10 and occasionally zone 6. In other areas, it can be grown as an annual lasting only until the first winter freeze or can be moved indoors to overwinter. Where Does Rosemary Grow Best? Native to the Mediterranean, rosemary grows best in USDA zones 7-10. For further protection from cold, drying winds, plant rosemary along the south or west side of the home along the foundation of the house."

    "content": "Salvia rosmarinus — Rosemary: An In-Depth Look Rosemary, botanically known as Salvia rosmarinus (formerly Rosmarinus officinalis), is a fragrant, drought-tolerant evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. Celebrated for its ornamental beauty, bold flavor, and traditional healing properties, rosemary has been cherished for centuries. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae), alongside other beloved herbs like basil, mint, sage, oregano, and thyme. With its aromatic, needle-like leaves and sprays of soft blue flowers, rosemary brings lasting beauty and practical charm to gardens, kitchens, and herbal apothecaries worldwide. Native Range Rosemary originates from the Mediterranean basin, spanning southern Europe—including Spain, France, Italy, Greece, and Turkey, as well as parts of North Africa. In the wild, it thrives in sun-soaked, rocky landscapes, coastal cliffs, and scrubby hillsides. Rosemary naturally prefers well-drained, sandy or stony soils, making it perfectly suited to dry, exposed environments where water is scarce but sunlight is abundant. Plant Type and Habit Rosemary is a versatile woody perennial and evergreen shrub, best known for its upright, bushy, and rounded shape. However, certain varieties, such as Creeping Rosemary, break the mold with graceful, trailing, or cascading forms, perfect for spilling over containers, walls, or garden edges. Size Mature plants generally grow 2–6 feet (0.6–1.8 meters) tall and 2–5 feet (0.6–1.5 meters) wide. Rosemary has a slow to moderate growth rate. Lifespan Rosemary is a long-lived perennial. Well-cared-for plants can live 20–30 years or more. Flowers The small, tubular flowers range from pale blue to white. In most temperate regions, rosemary’s peak flowering season spans from late winter or early spring through late spring and early summer. Some varieties, especially those grown in mild climates, can bloom sporadically year-round. It’s not unusual for rosemary to flower outside its typical season, including in fall or even winter, particularly in frost-free areas or when grown indoors. Light pruning after the first flush of flowers can often encourage a second, lighter bloom in midsummer. Foliage Rosemary leaves are slender, needle-like, and slightly leathery to the touch. They shimmer dark green on top with a silvery sheen underneath, adding texture and contrast to the plant. Just one brush releases their strong, refreshing scent—a signature feature of rosemary. The aromatic leaves grow along upright, woody stems that are angular and often square-shaped, a classic trait of mint family members. Hardiness Rosemary is winter hardy in USDA zones 8–11 and tolerates temperatures down to about 20°F (-6°C). It thrives in warm, dry climates and tolerates heat and humidity. Cold-hardy cultivars such as ‘Arp’ and ‘Madeline Hill’ can survive in zones 6–7 with proper winter protection. Uses Culinary: A staple herb used fresh or dried to flavor meats, breads, vegetables, soups, and infused oils. A key ingredient in many edible gardens. Medicinal: Cherished through history for aiding digestion, improving memory and circulation, and providing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits. Aromatherapy: Rosemary essential oil helps reduce stress, enhance mental clarity, and promote relaxation. Ground Cover: Prostrate or creeping varieties are ideal for cascading over walls, stabilizing dry banks, or softening slopes. Container Planting: Perfect for terracotta pots on patios, balconies, sunny windowsills, or entryways where its scent can be enjoyed up close. Houseplant: Can be grown indoors in a sunny window with plenty of light and good air circulation. Companion Planting: Naturally repels pests such as cabbage loopers, Mexican bean beetles, carrot flies, slugs, and snails. Mosquito-Repellent: The strong essential oils help repel mosquitoes, making it useful around seating areas or patios. Coastal Gardens: Thrives in salty air and well-drained sandy soils, making it ideal for coastal gardens. Pollinator Garden: A magnet for bees, butterflies, and even hummingbirds thanks to its nectar-rich flowers. Rock Garden: Complements stones and gravel with its aromatic foliage and rugged, drought-tolerant nature. Border Planting: Neatly defines pathways and garden beds while offering visual interest and fragrance. Foundation Planting: Works well near buildings thanks to its compact habit, evergreen foliage, and low maintenance needs. Hedge: Can be pruned into a dense, low hedge for boundaries or pathways. Wildlife Value Rosemary attracts pollinators, including bees, honeybees, bumblebees, butterflies, and even hummingbirds. Drought and Salt Tolerance Once established, rosemary is highly drought-tolerant. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and needs minimal supplemental water, making it ideal for xeriscaping and dry gardens. Rosemary is also salt-tolerant, making it a good choice for coastal gardens or areas exposed to sea spray. Deer and Rabbit Resistance Rosemary is generally avoided by deer and rabbits thanks to its pungent oils and tough leaves. It serves as a useful barrier plant in mixed borders. Toxicity According to the ASPCA, rosemary is non-toxic to cats, dogs, and horses. Invasiveness Rosemary, originally from the Mediterranean, is widely grown around the world for its culinary, medicinal, and ornamental uses—as well as for essential oils. It’s tough, heat- and drought-tolerant, and thrives in dry, rocky soils. Because it can spread by both seeds and cuttings, it’s been known to escape gardens and naturalize in the wild. In fact, it’s listed in the Global Compendium of Weeds as a “garden thug” and “cultivation escape,” and has been reported as invasive in Cuba. While it was once considered to have low weedy potential, its growing popularity and resilient nature make it more of a risk today, especially in places where it’s heavily cultivated near natural areas.How to Grow and Care for Rosemary Light Requirements Rosemary needs full sun to thrive and needs at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day. While it can tolerate light shade, insufficient light leads to leggy, weak growth. Soil This aromatic herb prefers sandy, poor to moderately fertile, slightly acidic, well-drained soils. It can grow in a variety of soil types, except for heavy clay soils, as long as the soil is not waterlogged. Watering Do not overwater this Mediterranean plant, as it is susceptible to root rot if the soil is too wet. It is best to water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. The Mediterranean shrub is drought tolerant once established. Fertilizing Rosemary does not need a lot of fertilizer, and over-fertilizing can actually be harmful to the plant. A light application of a balanced fertilizer in the spring can help to promote growth. Pruning Prune after flowering to maintain shape and promote bushiness. Remove dead or leggy stems annually. Overwintering In cold climates, grow rosemary in pots and bring indoors before frost. Place near a sunny window or under grow lights.Here's the text from all five images: Image 1: How to Harvest Rosemary When to Harvest Timing: Harvest rosemary anytime once the plant is established and has sufficient growth, typically after it reaches about 12 inches (30 cm) tall. Best Time of Day: For the most intense flavor and oil content, harvest in the morning after the dew has dried but before the heat of the day. Seasonal Harvest: Rosemary can be harvested year-round in mild climates. In colder zones, harvest before the first frost if plants are outdoors. How to Harvest Stem Cutting: Snip sprigs or stems with sharp, clean scissors or pruning shears. Cut just above a leaf node to encourage branching and fuller growth. Moderation: Never harvest more than one-third of the plant at a time to avoid stressing it. Prevention: Regular light harvesting not only provides fresh rosemary but also promotes bushier, healthier plants. Tips for Storing Rosemary Fresh Use: Use freshly cut rosemary sprigs immediately in cooking or floral arrangements. Refrigeration: Wrap fresh rosemary sprigs in a damp paper towel, place them in a plastic bag, and refrigerate. They will stay fresh for up to two weeks. Drying: Bundle stems and hang them upside down in a dry, well-ventilated place away from direct sunlight. Once dry, strip the leaves and store them in airtight containers. Freezing: Chop rosemary leaves and freeze them in ice cube trays with a little water or olive oil for easy use later in cooking. Image 2: How to Propagate Rosemary Rosemary is easy to propagate and multiply, especially through cuttings, which root quickly and reliably. Propagation by seed is slow, with low germination rates, while layering takes longer and requires more space and time, making cuttings the most efficient and practical method for most gardeners. From Cuttings Step 1 – Select a Stem: Choose a healthy, non-flowering stem about 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) long from a mature rosemary plant. Softwood or semi-hardwood cuttings taken in spring or early summer root best. Step 2 – Remove Lower Leaves: Strip the leaves from the bottom half of the cutting to expose the nodes. Leave a few leaves at the top. Step 3 – Optional: Dip in Rooting Hormone: To encourage faster root development, dip the cut end in rooting hormone powder (optional but helpful). Step 4 – Plant the Cutting: Insert the cutting into a pot filled with a well-draining medium such as a mix of perlite and peat, or a commercial seed-starting mix. Firm the soil gently around the stem. Step 5 – Provide the Right Conditions: Keep the pot in a bright, warm spot out of direct sunlight. Maintain humidity by loosely covering the pot with a clear plastic bag or placing it in a propagation dome. Step 6 – Water Lightly: Keep the soil lightly moist but not soggy. Good drainage is essential to prevent rot. Step 7 – Transplant: After 4–8 weeks, roots should develop. Gently tug the cutting to check for resistance, which indicates rooting. Transplant into a larger pot or directly into the garden once roots are well established. From Seeds Step 1 – Sow Indoors: Rosemary seeds can be slow to germinate. Start seeds indoors 8–10 weeks before the last frost using a seed-starting mix. Step 2 – Surface Sow: Lightly press the seeds onto the surface of the soil without covering them too deeply, as they need light to germinate. Step 3 – Maintain Warmth: Keep the soil temperature around 70°F (21°C). Germination may take 2–4 weeks or longer. Step 4 – Transplant Seedlings: Once seedlings have grown a few inches tall and have several sets of leaves, they can be transplanted into larger containers or into the garden. Image 3: By Layering Step 1 – Choose a Low Branch: In early spring, select a flexible, healthy stem near the base of the plant. Step 2 – Bend to the Ground: Gently bend the stem to the soil surface and make a small wound or scrape on the underside of the stem where it touches the ground. Step 3 – Secure and Cover: Pin the wounded part down with a landscape staple or wire and cover it with soil, leaving the tip exposed. Step 4 – Wait and Water: Keep the soil moist. Roots should form in a few weeks to a few months. Once rooted, snip the new plant from the parent and transplant. Tip Propagation is easiest in spring or early summer when rosemary is actively growing. Avoid propagating during the plant's dormant winter period. Image 4: Companion Planting with Rosemary Good Companions Cabbage: Rosemary helps deter cabbage loopers and carrot flies, making it a protective companion for cabbage. Beans: While rosemary and beans don't directly benefit each other, they don't compete and are compatible in mixed beds. Carrots: Rosemary helps repel carrot rust flies, which makes it an excellent neighbor in vegetable beds. Peppers: Rosemary adds pest resistance near peppers and thrives in similar dry, sunny conditions. Lavender, Marjoram, Oregano, Sage, Summer Savory, Tarragon, and Thyme: These Mediterranean herbs share similar sun, water, and soil needs, making them ideal companions. Bad Companions Mint: Mint has invasive roots and higher water needs. It can outcompete rosemary and invite pests that harm both plants. Basil: Although often grouped together, basil prefers wetter and humidity than rosemary, making them less compatible in the same bed. Pumpkin: Rosemary may repel pumpkin pests, but some gardeners report growth inhibition when planted too close. Keep them in separate beds for best results. Cucumber: Cucumber needs frequent watering, while rosemary thrives in dry soil. The difference in watering requirements makes them poor neighbors. Image 5: Common Pests and Diseases of Rosemary Pests Aphids: These small sap-sucking insects can cluster on new growth, causing leaves to curl and weaken. Spider Mites: Tiny pests that cause stippled, yellowing leaves and fine webbing, especially during hot, dry weather. Whiteflies: Small flying insects that feed on plant sap, leading to yellowing and wilting of leaves. Mealybugs: Soft-bodied insects that appear as white cottony masses on stems and leaves, weakening the plant over time. Slugs and Snails: These pests can chew irregular holes in lower leaves and stems, especially during wet conditions. Diseases Root Rot: Caused by overwatering or poor drainage, leading to yellowing leaves, wilting, and eventual plant death. Powdery Mildew: A fungal disease that appears as a white, powdery coating on the leaves, often during humid conditions with poor air circulation. Gray Mold (Botrytis): Causes fuzzy gray growth on stems and leaves, especially in damp, overcrowded plantings. Downy Mildew: Results in yellow to brown patches on leaves, with a downy white growth on the undersides. Leaf Spot: Fungal or bacterial spots appear on the leaves, causing premature leaf drop if left untreated. Prevention Tips Plant rosemary in well-draining soil and avoid overhead watering to prevent fungal issues. Space plants properly to ensure good air circulation. Inspect plants regularly for pests and remove affected parts promptly. Use natural remedies like neem oil or insecticidal soap for minor pest problems.Here's the text from the image: Frequently Asked Questions About Rosemary How to Make Rosemary Oil To make rosemary oil, place a handful of fresh rosemary sprigs into a clean, dry glass jar. Cover them completely with carrier oil, such as olive oil or jojoba oil. Seal the jar tightly and place it in a sunny windowsill for 2–4 weeks, shaking it gently every few days. Strain oil through a fine mesh sieve or cheesecloth into a clean container. Store the rosemary-infused oil in a cool, dark place and use it for culinary, haircare, or skincare purposes. How to Make Rosemary Water To prepare rosemary water, bring 2 cups of water to a boil, then add a few sprigs of fresh rosemary. Reduce the heat and simmer for 15–20 minutes. Let the mixture cool completely, then strain out the rosemary. Store the rosemary water in a spray bottle and use it as a refreshing hair rinse, skin toner, or garden spray to deter pests. Is Rosemary Safe for Dogs? Yes, rosemary is generally considered safe for dogs in small amounts. It is even found in some commercial dog foods due to its antioxidant properties. However, excessive consumption could cause digestive upset. Always consult your veterinarian before introducing new herbs to your pet's diet. Is Rosemary Safe for Cats? Yes, rosemary is non-toxic to cats according to the ASPCA. Small exposures, like brushing against the plant or nibbling a little, are generally harmless. Still, cats have sensitive stomachs, and eating large amounts may cause mild gastrointestinal discomfort. How to Dry Rosemary Harvest rosemary sprigs and tie them into small bundles. Hang them upside down in a warm, well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight. After about 10–14 days, the leaves should be completely dry and brittle. Strip the dried leaves from the stems and store them in an airtight container. How to Chop Rosemary Strip the rosemary leaves from their woody stems by running your fingers down the sprigs. Gather the leaves into a small pile on a cutting board and finely chop them using a sharp chef's knife. Minced rosemary adds flavor to meats, breads, and marinades. Is Rosemary a Perennial? Yes, rosemary is a perennial shrub in USDA hardiness zones 8–11. In colder climates, it may be grown as an annual or overwintered indoors. With proper care, rosemary can thrive for many years, offering evergreen foliage, fragrant blooms, and culinary benefits year-round."

    "content": "Rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus) is a fragrant and drought-tolerant perennial herb in the mint family that grows as a rounded, evergreen shrub with slender, needle-like, gray-green leaves on erect woody stems. Clusters of small, light blue to white flowers appear in spring and summer. Plant rosemary in USDA zones 8 to 10 in the spring when temperatures stay between 55 degrees and 80 degrees or grow indoors as a houseplant. Rosemary has a moderate growth rate, reaching its mature size between 2 and 6 feet tall after several years. This is an easy-to-grow culinary herb, favored in cooking for its earthy, citrusy, and peppery taste. closeup of rosemary Credit: The Spruce / Randi Rhoades Common Name Rosemary Botanical Name Salvia rosmarinus Family Lamiaceae Plant Type Herb, perennial Size 2–6 ft. tall, 2–4 ft. wide Sun Exposure Full sun Soil Type Sandy, loamy, well-drained Soil pH Acidic, neutral Bloom Time Spring, summer Hardiness Zones 8–10 (USDA) Native Area Mediterranean How to Plant Rosemary When to Plant Plant rosemary in the spring once the weather has warmed and there is no forecasted frost. Container-grown rosemary can be planted any time of the year. However, it goes dormant during the winter. Where to Plant Place rosemary in a sunny spot with sharp-draining soil. Good companion plants for rosemary include cruciferous vegetables (kale, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts), beans, carrots, and spinach. Rosemary also grows well in containers both outdoors and indoors, as long as it can get enough sunlight. It can be slightly challenging to give rosemary enough light indoors and the plant usually won’t last as long as it does outdoors, which is usually around 10 years. How to Plant Space rosemary shrubs at least two to three feet apart. Plant seedlings and nursery plants at the same depth at which they were growing in their previous container. Seeds should be just barely covered with soil when planting. A support structure is typically not necessary for this shrub. Why You Should Grow Rosemary Rosemary is a low-maintenance herb that can be used as a decorative hedge or even be added to rock gardens for a pop of greenery. It also has beautiful flowers that can attract pollinators in the warmer seasons, and can be grown near pathways and seating areas for a fragrant smell. Rosemary Plant Care Here are the main care requirements for growing a rosemary plant: Choose a location with bright and full sunlight, like a spot near a south-facing window. Water sparingly and check the top soil to make sure it's completely dry before watering. Plant in sandy or loamy soil. Maintain warm temperatures between 55 degrees and 80 degrees. For a healthy start, mix compost into the soil. Light Rosemary likes full sun and does not tolerate any shade. This means it requires at least six hours of direct sunlight on most days. A south-facing window is ideal for indoor growth, and grow lights are often necessary to provide supplemental light. Bring indoor plants outside in warm weather to allow them access to natural sunlight. Inadequate light can cause leggy and weak growth. Soil Use sandy or loamy soil for rosemary. The plant is easy to grow when planted in well-draining soil and it can get root rot in overly wet or cold soil. A slightly acidic to neutral soil pH is ideal. Water Rosemary is quite drought-tolerant once established, and it’s better to water sparingly rather than overwater them. Allow the top few inches of soil to dry out between waterings, and then water so that the soil is evenly moist but not soggy. Avoid Overwatering Knowing exactly when to water rosemary can be a challenge, especially when growing it in pots. Using a moisture meter can help. Use the meter to evaluate the soil, and if it's still \"moist\" or \"wet,\" do not add more water. Temperature and Humidity This shrub likes warm weather and moderate humidity levels. Most rosemary varieties can’t survive temperatures below 30 degrees, but they have good heat tolerance. They prefer temperatures between 55 degrees and 80 degrees. High humidity can lead to rot and fungal issues, especially if there isn’t enough air circulation around the plant. Fertilizer Rosemary is not a heavy feeder. Mixing compost into the soil at the time of planting helps give the shrub a healthy start. Then, use a balanced liquid fertilizer, following label instructions, to promote quality growth. Pollination Rosemary shrubs self-pollinate and attract bees and other pollinators to the garden. Bring indoor plants outdoors in warm weather when their flowers are open to allow the blooms to naturally pollinate. closeup of rosemary plant Credit: Leticia Almeida / The Spruce pinching off rosemary a rosemary plant on a windowsill flowering rosemary Harvesting Rosemary Harvest rosemary any time of year, though it grows most actively in the spring and summer. Harvest by using pruners to cut off 4- to 6-inch stem tips. Dry rosemary by hanging the stems upside-down in a dry, cool, well-ventilated area, which should take a couple of weeks. Once the stems are dry, strip off the leaves and keep them in an airtight container in a pantry. Use fresh rosemary sprigs or leaves in cooking rather than drying if you prefer. The leaves are most flavorful and aromatic just before the plant blooms. Harvesting Tip When harvesting rosemary, always aim to leave behind 6 inches of stem so it doesn't deplete the plant's resources too much. Types of Rosemary There are several types of rosemary to grow, including: ‘Arp’: This plant has light green foliage with a lemony scent, and it’s known for its cold tolerance. ‘Golden Rain’: This plant stays compact at two to three feet high and wide, and it features yellow markings on its foliage. ‘Albus’: The trademark of this cultivar is its white flowers. ‘Prostratus’: This cultivar has a low, spreading growth habit at around two feet high and two to three feet wide. Evergreen Rosemary is an evergreen plant, which means it will retain its leaves through winter and provide color in the landscape. Pruning Prune rosemary as necessary to shape its growth after the plant is done flowering. Rosemary responds well to pruning and can also be trained into topiary shapes. Don’t prune off more than a third of the plant at a time, as this can stress the shrub and leave it vulnerable to diseases and pests. Pruning Tip Looking for the best pruners for your rosemary plant? We tested 10 top-rated pruners in our Lab to make sure your plant stays happy and healthy. Propagating Rosemary Propagate rosemary with a cutting from a mature plant in the spring or summer. Cut a few inches of healthy new softwood growth and remove the lower leaves (keep a few at the top of the stem). Dip the end of the cutting in rooting hormone if placing it in a moist sandy, soilless potting mix. Or, keep the cutting in a container of fresh water. Either way, place the cutting in a warm, bright spot. The cutting is ready for transplanting after roots form. Rooting Rosemary Rooting rosemary in water produces quicker but more delicate roots. Putting a cutting in sand or soilless mix takes longer but develops stronger roots that may offer the best results when transferring seedlings to the soil. How to Grow Rosemary From Seed Growing rosemary from seeds can be difficult, because they don't germinate easily. You'll be better off getting a seedling from the grocery store or a big-box store. If you want to try growing rosemary from seed, you need soil, seed trays, plastic wrap (if the tray doesn't come with a cover), and ideally a heat mat and grow light. Soak. Soak the rosemary seeds for 24 hours before planting to improve germination. Prep the trays. Fill the seed starting trays with moist seed-starting mix. Plant the seeds. Scatter the seeds on top of the seed starting trays. Increase humidity and warmth. Cover the tray with plastic wrap or a plastic cover to keep humidity high. Set the tray on a heat mat or in a warm location, like on top of the fridge. Maintain ideal conditions. Remove the cover occasionally to allow for some air circulation. Mist soil or bottom water to keep soil moist. Remove plastic. Once the seedlings have sprouted, remove the plastic wrap and put the tray in a bright location, ideally under a grow light. Transfer. Once the seedlings are around 3 inches tall, move them to individual pots, and then outdoors once the weather is warm enough. Potting and Repotting Rosemary Growing rosemary in pots allows you to bring it indoors during cold weather. Keep containers on a patio or deck near your kitchen for easy access. Select a pot that’s slightly larger than the plant’s root ball. Make sure it has drainage holes. An unglazed clay container is best to allow excess soil moisture to evaporate through its walls. Rosemary needs excellent soil drainage, so use a potting mix that contains perlite, which helps keep the soil light and well-aerated. Plan to repot every year into one container size up, using fresh potting mix. The best time to repot is in the spring. Gently loosen the plant from its previous container and situate it at the same depth in the new one, filling around the roots with soil. Overwintering Bring rosemary indoors well before any frost is predicted in the fall forecast. Keep it in a warm room and away from any drafts or drying air from heat vents. Continue providing it with at least six hours of sunlight per day via a bright window and/or grow light. Back off slightly on watering in winter, though don’t allow the soil to fully dry out. Once frost is out of the forecast in the spring, the plant can go back outside. Common Pests & Plant Diseases High humidity and poor air circulation can result in powdery mildew—a white, powdery fungus—on rosemary plants. Powdery mildew typically won't kill a plant, but the disease will weaken it. To prevent powdery mildew, make sure the plant's soil isn't too wet, and provide good airflow. Also, be on the lookout for aphids and spider mites, especially on indoor plants. Use an insecticidal soap as soon as you spot an infestation to prevent it from spreading. Pest to Watch A good indication that your plant may have aphids is if you notice ants on your plant. Ants appear to feast on the honeydew secretions left behind by aphids. FAQ Does rosemary come back every year? Rosemary is an evergreen perennial and can live up to 10 years within its hardiness range. Where should I not plant rosemary? Do not plant rosemary in any shade. In addition, avoid planting rosemary around plants that have different moisture or maintenance needs, especially including basil, mint, tomatoes, pumpkin, or cucumber. Why doesn't my rosemary plant smell? Rosemary doesn't smell when its aromatic oils are dried up or diminished. Boost the oils and increase the plant's fragrance by growing rosemary in full sunlight and well-draining but moist soil. Feeding rosemary too much fertilizer may also diminish the plant's fragrance. How can you keep rosemary over the winter season? If you have any leftover rosemary and want to keep it fresh through winter, cut the branches, give them a quick rinse, and dry them out completely. Afterwards, store them in a tight Ziplock bag by getting rid of the excess air and storing them in the freezer."

Whether you’re a seasoned plant parent or someone who’s just managed to keep a cactus alive, aloe vera is your new low-maintenance best friend. Not only does it look cool with its spiky green leaves, but it moonlights as a natural remedy for life’s little burns and boo-boos. From choosing the perfect sunny windowsill to knowing when (and when not) to water, we’re here to make sure your aloe thrives, not just survives. Let’s get growing! About Aloe Vera Aloe vera is a succulent plant species of the genus Aloe. The plant is stemless or short-stemmed with thick, greenish, fleshy leaves that fan out from the plant’s central stem. The margin of the leaf is serrated with small teeth. Before you buy an aloe, note that you’ll need a location that offers bright, indirect sunlight (or artificial sunlight). Direct sunlight can dry out the plant too much and turn its fleshy leaves yellow, so you may need to water more often if your aloe lives in an exceedingly sunny spot. Keep the aloe vera plant in a pot near a kitchen window for periodic use. WARNING: The gel from aloe vera leaves can be used topically but should NOT be eaten by people or pets. It can cause unpleasant symptoms such as nausea or indigestion and may even be toxic in larger quantities. Read Next Aloe Vera: A Self-Regenerating First-Aid Kit Top Succulent Plants for the Home Houseplant Care Guide Planting Before Planting Aloe Vera It’s important to choose the right type of container. A pot made from terra-cotta or similar porous material is recommended, as it will allow the soil to dry thoroughly between waterings and will also be heavy enough to keep the plant from tipping over. A plastic or glazed pot may also be used, though these will hold more moisture. When choosing a container, pick one with at least one drainage hole in the bottom. This is key, as the hole will allow excess water to drain out. Aloe vera plants are hardy, but a lack of proper drainage can cause rot and wilting, which is easily the most common cause of death for this plant. Select a container that’s about as wide as it is deep. If your aloe plant has a stem, choose a container deep enough to plant the entire stem under the soil. Aloe vera plants are succulents, so use a well-draining potting mix, such as those made for cacti and succulents. Do not use gardening soil. A good mix should contain perlite, lava rock, chunks of bark, or all three. A layer of gravel, clay balls, or any other drainage material in the bottom of the pot is not necessary. This only takes up space that the roots could otherwise be using. A drainage hole is drainage enough! (Optional) To encourage your aloe to put out new roots after planting, dust the stem of the plant with a rooting hormone powder. Rooting hormone can be found at a local garden center or hardware store or bought online. how to care for aloe vera infographic How to Plant (or Repot) an Aloe Vera Plant If your aloe plant has grown leggy, has gotten too large, or simply needs an upgrade, it’s time to repot it. Here’s how: Prepare your pot. After giving the new pot a quick rinse (or a good scrub if it’s a pot you’ve used before) and letting it dry thoroughly, place a small piece of screen over the drainage hole; this will keep the soil from falling out the bottom and will allow water to drain properly. A doubled-up piece of paper towel or newspaper can also work in a pinch, though these will break down over time. Prepare your plant. Remove the aloe vera plant from its current pot and brush away any excess dirt from the roots, being careful not to damage the roots. If your plant has any pups, remove them now. (See “Care” below for instructions on removing and potting pups.) If your plant has a very long, spindly stem that won’t fit in the pot, it is possible to trim the stem off partially. Note that this is risky and could kill the plant. To trim the stem: Cut off part of the stem, leaving as much as possible on the plant. Next, place the bare plant in a warm area that gets indirect light. After several days, a callus will form over the wound. At this point, continue with the repotting instructions below. Plant your plant. Fill the pot about a third of the way with a well-draining potting mix, then place your plant in the soil. Continue filling in the soil around the plant, bearing in mind that you should leave at least 3/4 of an inch of space between the top of the soil and the rim of the pot. The bottom leaves of the aloe plant should rest just above the soil, too. Do not water after planting. Ignore your plant (temporarily). After you’ve placed your aloe in its new pot, don’t water it for at least a week. This will decrease the chance of inducing rot and give the plant time to put out new roots. Until the plant seems to be rooted and happy, please keep it in a warm place that receives bright but indirect light. Aloe vera plants in pots Growing How to Care for an Aloe Vera Plant Lighting: Place in bright, indirect sunlight or artificial light. A western or southern window is ideal. Aloe that are kept in low light often grow leggy. Temperature: Aloe vera does best in temperatures between 55° and 80°F (13° and 27°C). The temperatures of most homes and apartments are ideal. From May to September, you can bring your plant outdoors without any problems, but do bring it back inside in the evening if nights are cold. Fertilizing: Fertilize sparingly (no more than once a month) and only in the spring and summer with a balanced houseplant formula mixed at 1/2 strength. Repotting: Repot when root-bound, following the instructions given in “Planting” above. Watering Aloe Vera Watering is the most challenging part of keeping aloe vera healthy, but it’s certainly not rocket science! The aloe is a succulent plant accustomed to arid environments, but its thick leaves still need sufficient water. Water aloe vera plants deeply but infrequently. In other words, the soil should feel moist after watering but should be allowed to dry out to some extent before you water again. If the soil stays overly wet, the plant’s roots can rot. To ensure that you’re not overwatering your plant, allow the top third of potting soil to dry out between waterings. For example, if your plant is kept in 6 inches of potting soil, allow the top 2 inches to dry out before watering again. (Use your finger to test the dryness of the soil.) Generally speaking, plan to water your aloe plant about every 2–3 weeks in the spring and summer and even more sparingly during the fall and winter. One rule to remember for fall and winter watering is to roughly double the time between waterings (compared to your summer watering schedule). In other words, if you water every 2 weeks in summer, water every 4 weeks in winter. When watering, some excess water may run out of the bottom of the pot. Let the pot sit in this water so the soil absorbs as much as possible. Wait 10–15 minutes, then dump any remaining water. Aloe vera plants and pups Photo by cgdeaw/Shutterstock Removing and Replanting Aloe Vera Offsets (Pups) Mature aloe vera plants often produce offsets— plantlets, pups, or babies—that can be removed to produce an entirely new plant (a clone of the mother plant, technically). Find where the offsets are attached to the mother plant and separate them using pruning shears, scissors, or a sharp knife. Leave at least an inch of stem on the offset. Allow the offsets to sit out of the soil for several days; this lets the offset form a callus over the cut, which helps to protect it from rot. Keep the offsets in a warm location with indirect light during this time. Once the offsets have formed calluses, pot them in a standard succulent potting mix. The soil should be well-draining. Put the newly potted pups in a sunny location. Wait at least a week to water and keep the soil on the dry side. How to Get Your Aloe Vera to Flower Mature aloe vera plants occasionally produce a tall flower spike—called an inflorescence—from which dozens of tubular yellow or red blossoms appear. This certainly adds another level of interest to the already lovely aloe! Unfortunately, a bloom is rarely achievable with aloes that are kept as houseplants since the plant requires nearly ideal conditions to produce flowers: lots of light, sufficient water, and the right temperature range. Due to these requirements (mainly lighting), aloe flowers are usually only seen on plants grown outdoors year-round in warm climates. To give your aloe the best shot at flowering: Provide it with as much light as possible, especially during spring and summer. Aloes can be kept outdoors in full sun during the summer when temperatures are above 70°F (21°C). Bring the aloe inside if nighttime temps threaten to drop below 60°F (16°C). Note: Don’t move your aloe from indoors to full sun right away; it needs time to adjust to the intense light, or it may cause sunburn. Allow it to sit in partial shade for about a week before moving it to a brighter location. Ensure the plant is getting the right amount of water—enough to keep it from drying out completely but not enough to drown it! If the plant’s being kept outdoors, make sure that it’s not getting consistently soaked by summer rains. Give your aloe a proper dormancy period in the fall and winter. Aloe tends to bloom in late winter or early spring, so giving them a period of rest consisting of less frequent watering and cooler temperatures may encourage them to flower. Don’t be surprised if it still doesn’t flower. Despite our best efforts, indoor conditions just aren’t ideal for most aloes, so don’t be surprised if yours simply refuses to bloom! Types Especially attractive Aloe include: Aloe variegata Tiger or Partridge-Breasted Aloe – A compact aloe characterized by short, smooth leaves with uneven white stripes. A. aristata Lace Aloe – A small plant with white-spotted, finely sawtoothed leaves. A. glauca Blue Aloe – A larger aloe species with silver-blue leaves. Harvesting Aloe Vera Gel To make use of the aloe vera plant’s soothing properties, remove a mature leaf from the plant and cut it lengthwise. Squeeze the gel out of the leaf and apply it to your burn, or lay the opened leaf, gel side down, on the affected area. Learn more about aloe vera’s healing properties. Do not ingest the gel, as it can cause nausea and other unpleasant symptoms.

Aloe Vera, also known by its botanical name “Aloe barbadensis”, is a succulent family member with over 300 species found worldwide. This desert-native plant enjoys hot and tropical climates. It’s reasonably drought-resistant and can be found worldwide from the Californian coastline to the tip of Africa. The aloe vera plant has a long rich history and is known as one of the oldest plants on record due to its vast medicinal properties and health benefits. The Egyptians were the first to record the nourishing benefits some 6,000 years ago; even Cleopatra is said to have incorporated aloe into her daily skin regime! The Aloe plant is known for its thick, succulent leaves plumped with a watery gel-like substance. The leaves grow from the plant’s base in a rosette shape with flexible spines with jagged edges. Once matured, this plant can grow spiky flowers in shades of yellow, orange and red; however, many young plants can take years to produce a flower or, in some cases, never do. Looking to introduce an Aloe Vera plant to your growing plant family? Read on to learn more about how you can care for your Aloe at home. Where to buy aloe vera ireland How to care for your Aloe Vera Aloe has won over the hearts of many plant lovers for its hardiness and tolerance of infrequent watering. Here are some key care tips to keep your Aloe happy and healthy: Sun illustration Light- Aloe vera require lots of bright indirect sunlight. We recommend typically 6-8 hours per day. Your Aloe will be happiest on a sunny window ledge. Water illustrationWater- Aloe can handle drought conditions but prefers to be watered regularly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. If the plant is left dry too long, the leaves will wilt and pucker slightly. They also cannot tolerate standing in water so, ensure there are plenty of drainage holes in your plant to allow excess water to run out. To ensure drainage in a pot, you can use cactus potting soil or mix in some perlite or coarse sand and make your own mix. Thermostat illustrationTemperature-. Aloe vera gel is 96% water — which is why it can stand up to desert conditions. Your little Aloe enjoys an average temperature between 13°C.-18°C. From May to September, you can bring your Aloe outdoors but do bring it back inside in the evening or when temperatures begin to drop. In the winter months, keep away from areas with fluctuating temperatures and drafts. Feed- Aloe vera does not require high soil fertility. Feeding once a year, in the spring, with a houseplant fertiliser should be sufficient. Cleaning- Aloe vera plants are reasonably resistant to disease however indoor growers might find some issues with mealybugs and scale. Avoid overwatering your Aloe and keep the stems dust-free to prevent these issues from occurring. aloe vera uses Typical Uses of Aloe Vera Rated as one of the best air-purifying plants by Nasa's Clean Air Study, Aloe Vera works to remove harmful toxins and pollutants in the air and boost the room’s humidity. This can decrease the level of airborne diseases that can contribute to cold or flu-like symptoms. And, as if that wasn’t enough, this hardworking plant has been used as a medicinal plant for thousands because of the many healing powers contained within its leaves. Aloe Vera is proven to contain vitamins and enzymes that detoxify and support the immune system, lower cholesterol and blood sugar, digestion, provide a boost of vitamins, and help with acne and dehydrated skin. The gel within the plant is loaded with healing vitamins, antioxidants, and nutrients and can improve and soothe dry skin, burns and acne. It’s worth noting that while aloe vera is gentle, some people have been known to develop skin irritations and allergic reactions from it. The gel should never be used on cuts or burns that are quite serious. Always test a small amount on a tiny patch of skin before applying to the affected area and stop use if irritation occurs. aloe vera benefits Where to Keep Your Aloe Vera at Home This versatile plant is known to shine in any space within the home or workspace however, we believe it works best on a kitchen windowsill, where it acts as a self-regenerating first-aid kit.

    "content": "An aloe-killer’s guide to thriving aloe vera plants Veronica May 8, 2025 Aloe vera has a mixed reputation: some aloe parents can do no wrong, while others feel they can’t do anything right (and have many dead aloes to prove it). What’s weird is that the aloe-killers among us might have the ‘greenest’ thumbs. I used to be in the green-thumbed aloe-killer camp, but after lots of research, trial and error I’ve unearthed several simple tricks to keep aloes happy. Whichever group you belong to, your aloes will thank you – and reward you – for reading this Aloe-Killer’s Guide to Thriving Aloe Vera Plants! Are you ready to help your aloes grow like mad and produce a bunch of aloe babies? Let’s dig in! Aloe Origins The first step to understanding your green friend is to learn its origins – its native habitat. You may have plucked your baby from the shelf of a home goods store, but that’s not what we’re talking about. Aloes originated in South Africa. Picture sunny, hot dry days and sandy, red soils cracked and thirsting for the infrequent blessing of rain. This environment is harsh for many people and plants, but this is exactly the context where aloes adapted to flourish. So, here is the first insight – aloes like it tough. They thrive on droughts, soak up simmering heat and don’t care for rich, fertile soils. This is where good-intentioned, hyper-involved plant parents get off to a bad start with aloes. Aloes just don’t want the kind of attentive care and common enjoyments that most other plants eat up. However, it’s important not to go extreme with the neglect either! Water Control is Key The leading cause of aloe demise is too much water. What throws aloe parents for a loop is that watering frequency is just a small part of the equation! Most of the advice that follows pertains to keeping water levels in your aloe’s potting mix exactly right. How Frequently Should I Water My Aloe? You’re going to love this answer: it depends! Not helpful, I know. I will unpack that. But! This is an important point here. It’s really key to water your aloe based on when it needs it and not based on a schedule. The better question to ask is: How do I know when my aloe wants water? 3 Signs Your Aloe Wants a Drink 1. The pinch test: Give a few of your aloe leaves a light squeeze. How firm does the leaf feel? Is there a little give when you pinch? Aloe leaves are basically water reservoirs, like the humps on a camel’s back. When the leaves lose some firmness, this indicates that the plant is using its water reserves and will want a drink sometime soon. Don’t wait until the aloe uses so much of its reserves that the leaves start to flop over or bend in the middle. To stick with the metaphor: water before you have floppy camel humps! At first the pinch test may be a difficult way to gauge the right moment to water, but it is the most accurate measure and you will get a feel for it after a few water cycles! 2. The finger test: Poke a finger into the soil a few inches down. Dry as a bone? Water immediately if the leaves look floppy. If the leaves are fine, wait a few days to give your aloe a period of complete drought, then water. 3. The looky-loo: When in doubt, pull it out! Wait, that sounds wrong… Um, if you are more of an eyes-on kind of person you can pull your aloe out of its pot to see if the soil is completely dry. This is also a great opportunity to see how the root system is doing (more on roots later). The Gist of Watering Air humidity, ambient temperature, pot, soil mix, root system and sunlight – all of these factors combine to impact how often an aloe is watered. As a general guide, aloes like water every one to three weeks in summer and less frequently in winter when aloes go dormant and do not put energy into new growth. Potting Mix: The Keeper of Water The potting medium your aloe lives in determines how much moisture is retained after a watering. Regular potting mix or garden soil holds onto water like a sponge. If you think back to its native habitat, that’s not what aloe wants! Aloes like a sandy potting mix with great drainage. Store-bought cactus or succulent mixes work quite well, but there may be room for improvement. If you notice the potting medium holding onto a lot of water for days, amend the soil with materials like coarse builder’s sand*, chicken grit, perlite or pumice to improve drainage and provide a lighter, airier space for aloe roots. Experiment with different potting mixes to find the combination that works best! * Avoid fine grain sand, like play sand 5 Keys to Picking the Perfect Pot Now here is a factor you may have overlooked: the material, size and shape of your pot plays a huge role in regulating water! 1. Plastic vs. Terracotta: If you live in a cool and humid climate you likely struggle with soil holding too much water. In this case, terracotta will make an excellent pot because its porous nature will wick away extra moisture sitting in the soil. If you live in a hot and dry environment where soil dries out fast, non-porous pots like plastic work best. This wide, shallow pot is perfect for aloes! 2. Go wide, not deep: Aloes have shallow root systems that like to stretch out and don’t do much downward exploration. Pick a pot that is wider than it is deep to match that growth habit. Deep pots are a one-way ticket to root rot town. If there are no roots at the bottom of the pot, the moisture in that soil will not be consumed by the aloe and bing-bam-boom you’ve got root rot! 3. Keep it cozy: Aloes like to be a bit pot-bound. The roots of your aloe should take up about half the pot, by volume to keep a cozy environment for the roots. This also helps prevent overwatering, because there is just a small amount of soil to hold on to moisture. 4. Let it drain: Drainage holes are key because pooling water will be the death of your aloe. I know, often the prettiest pots don’t have holes. But for the sake of your aloe, either drill a hole in the pot with a diamond-tipped drill bit or save it for another plant that likes wet soil. 5. Leave room for pups: With this guide in hand, there is no doubt you are going to have a happy aloe – and happy aloes like to have pups (little aloe babies)! Leave some space for aloe babies to emerge by choosing a pot that is a little wider than the current plant needs. Aloes Like it Hot – but Not Too Hot! Aloes are happiest in 55 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 27 degrees Celsius) and live natively in USDA hardiness zones 9 through 11. If you live in cooler climates, aloes will be happy indoors all year round. When the weather warms up you may be tempted to bring your aloe outside for a summer vacation. If you do bring your aloe outside, be sure to make it a gradual transition over the span of a week (starting your aloe off in a shadier and cooler location to mimic its indoor environment) and monitor how your aloe responds. A quick change in sunlight and temperature exposure from bringing your aloe outdoors can shock and kill your aloe: summer vacation can quickly turn into death in paradise. Your aloe’s final destination outdoors should provide bright indirect sun throughout the day, and potentially several hours of direct sun in the morning (depending on your aloe’s unique preferences).

Aloes absolutely love bright sun, but it can become too much of a good thing. Set up indoor aloes around south-facing windows, but don’t let the leaves directly touch the glass to keep them safe. Window glass can intensify sun beams and sizzle aloe leaves. Burnt aloe leaf tip If you notice your aloe leaves turn pale, orange or brown it’s likely that your aloe is getting too much sun — but don’t fret! There is a simple solution: relocate your aloe to a shadier spot. Jasmine Rosie from the gardenstead succulent group did exactly this when she noticed her aloes turning orange. Her aloe not only bounced back, but is doing better than ever! Jasmin Rosie's aloe. Photos courtesy of Jasmine Rosie. These pale-orange leaves indicate sun stress. Photo courtesy of Rita Kurgan. If you don’t have an abundance of light, that’s okay — I don’t either and I grow aloes anyway! You’ll notice that aloes with less-than-optimal light will grow leggier and floppier leaves, but the plant will continue to live and grow. If you want the best for your aloe, consider popping a grow light over it to make up for the lack of natural rays. Aloe’s Got 99 Problems but Fertilizer Ain’t One Perhaps after reading all this you’re starting to feel like aloes are a bit finicky. Thankfully, when it comes to fertilizing, aloes are low-key. Aloes don’t need any fertilizer, but if you want to give your aloe a jolt of energy to kick off the growing season, you can supply it with a phosphorus-heavy, water-based fertilizer at half strength once a year in spring (try saying that ten times fast!). A houseplant fertilizer with a ratio around 10-40-10 (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium) should do the trick. Say Aloe to My Little Friend! Forming a friendly relationship with your plants is all about understanding who they are and what they need. That’s why, at gardenstead, we believe that anyone armed with the right tips and an experimental mindset can keep their plants happy and thriving – and aloe is not an exception to that! Now that you’ve got all the dirt and details on how to make aloes happy, go forth and make friends with aloes! They are a good buddy when you get to know them and have lots to give back.

Whether you’re a first-time plant parent or a seasoned green thumb, this striking succulent is your go-to for clean air and effortless greenery. Here’s how to keep it thriving in your home! About Snake Plants Native to southern Africa, snake plants are well adapted to conditions similar to those in southern regions of the United States. Because of this, they may be grown outdoors almost all year in USDA Zone 8 and warmer. However, they spread by sending out underground runners and may become invasive, so treat snake plants like you would bamboo; plant them only in contained areas or pots. Too much water and freezing temperatures are two of the very few things that can affect this plant in a significant way. Soggy soil will cause root rot, and extended exposure to cold temperatures can damage the foliage.

Terracotta pots work well for snake plants since they allow the soil to dry out more quickly than plastic pots. Use a well-draining potting mix. A potting mix designed for cacti and succulents is ideal, as it will be more resistant to becoming oversaturated with water. When repotting snake plants, don’t bury them too deep. The plant should be planted as deep as it had been in its prior container. Choosing a Location in the Home Snake plants prefer bright, indirect light and can even tolerate some direct sunlight. However, they also grow well (albeit more slowly) in shady corners and other low-light areas of the home. Tip: Avoid moving your plant from a low-light area to direct sunlight too quickly, as this can shock the plant. Whenever you move plants from a darker to a lighter spot, gradually expose them to brighter and brighter light over a week or so. Also, be sure to adjust watering habits accordingly; plants will use more water in warmer, brighter areas. Keep the plant in a warm spot with temperatures above 50°F (10°C). In the winter, protect it from drafty windows. Potted snake plants in a nursery Photo by Mokkie/Wikimedia Commons Growing How to Water Snake Plants One of the most common problems encountered with snake plants (and other succulents) is overwatering. These plants do not tolerate soggy soil; they tend to develop root rot. To avoid this, follow these watering practices: Do not water too frequently. Let the soil mostly dry out between waterings. Tip: To know when it’s time to water, don’t just rely on how the surface of the soil looks. Instead, carefully stick your finger or a wooden chopstick a couple of inches into the soil. Hold off watering if you feel any moisture or see soil sticking to the chopstick. Water from the bottom of the pot, if possible. This encourages the roots to grow downward and deep, helping to stabilize the thick, tall leaves. During the winter, while the plant isn’t actively growing, water less often than you would in spring and summer. Caring for Snake Plants The large, flat leaves tend to collect dust; wipe them down with a damp cloth as needed. Snake plants are rapid growers in good conditions and may need to be divided annually. Divide and repot in the spring. Cut out a section containing leaves and roots and place it in a pot with a well-draining potting mix. If a snake plant is pot-bound, it may flower occasionally. Fragrant, greenish-white flower clusters appear on tall spikes. Types Dracaena trifasciata (aka Sansevieria trifasciata) is the most common species of snake plant. It has tall, dark-green leaves with light grayish-green horizontal stripes. ‘Bantel’s Sensation’ — Narrow leaves have white vertical stripes and grow to about 3 feet long. This variety can be hard to find. D. hahnii: ‘Bird’s Nest’ — Short, wide leaves of dark and light green form a tight nest shape like a bromeliad. Leaves only grow 6 to 8 inches long. This variety does need much light to grow well. ‘Golden Hahnii’ — Like the standard ‘Bird’s Nest’ but with leaves variegated along the edge in yellow. D. cylindrica: ‘Cylindrical Snake Plant’ — As its name suggests, this species of snake plant has cylindrical leaves that end in a fierce point. ‘Starfish Snake Plant’ — The starfish snake plant has cylindrical leaves that fan out from its base, giving it a starfish-like shape. D. masoniana: ‘Whale Fin’ — These interesting snake plants have large, wide leaves that resemble the fin of a whale breaching the water’s surface."

Sansevieria (also known as Mother-in-Law Tongue or Snake Plant) is an amazing plant. The sansevieria originally came from Africa and made its way to Europe in the 18th century. The scientific name for this particular sansevieria is Dracaena Trifasciata. Its sword-like leaves have striking sculptural beauty and the care is very simple. I have snake plants in nearly every room of my home and they bring lots of visual interest to the environment! Related: Love plants?

Table of Contents Potting Fertilizing Repotting How Much Light Does a Snake Plant Need? Watering Humidity Dusting Propagating Other Species of Snake Plants Troubleshooting There have been studies that show the sansevieria removes harmful chemicals from the environment and releases oxygen, resulting in it having air purifying qualities. The jury is still out on how effective it is in purifying the air, but I still have one in almost every room 🙂 This special plant is a great starter houseplant green-thumb beginners as it can tolerate drought and low-light situations and with its easy care, you can’t go wrong with it! In this post, I wanted to share some tips on caring for your sansevieria. Potting When you get a sansevieria from the garden store or maybe a friend shared part of theirs, you need to know the best repotting tips so your so your new plant can thrive. First, snake plants LOVE well draining soil. Avoid compact soil because this kind of soil will hold more moisture and could lead to root rot. Root rot is when the soil gets waterlogged. If the plant stays wet for too long, the roots can rot and eventually, your plant will die. This is the quickest way to kill a sansevieria. These plants are very similar to cacti when it comes to their care. They don’t like to be sitting in water for too long. One of the main things that will keep your plant from root rot is well draining soil. You can buy a premade cactus/succulent soil (it’s a mix of sand and soil) and most garden stores will carry it. Having the sand in the soil will keep the soil aerated and let the water run through the soil. Adding a scoop of Perlite is a wonderful addition if you’d like to maximize the soil’s aeration. Perlite is naturally derived and comes from volcanic eruptions. If you add your own sand to your soil mix, make sure it’s made specifically for gardeners and growers. Other sands (like play sand) are actually more compact and not the best for drainage in your plants. It may go without saying, but never use soil that has been outside. This will make your plant susceptible to pests or other organisms found outdoors. I did this once and learned my lesson very quickly and brought in extra little critters that were harmful to my plant. For pots, I love terracotta pots. These are the reddish clay ones that you can find almost anywhere. The terracotta allows the dirt to “breathe” so the moisture isn’t trapped inside. Terra cotta pots help with avoiding root rot as well. The plant will dry out much faster in a terracotta pot because the clay wick’s water is from the soil. I have some plants in decorative earthenware pots that are not terracotta as well, but they all have a drainage hole at the bottom. Make sure all pots have a drainage hole so the water has a way of escaping! Sitting water at the bottom of your pot will likely lead to death by root rot. Sometimes, I will find a gorgeous clay pot but there is no hole on the bottom! This is easily fixed by drilling a hole using a specific drill bit. A quick YouTube video will teach you what you need to know if you’ve never drilled a hole in a pot. Fertilizing Your snake plant won’t need a lot of fertilization, but you can mix up a general plant fertilizer at half-strength and feed it at the beginning of spring the beginning of the growing season) and again in the middle of summer for a nutrient boost. Repotting I repot my sansevieria only when they need a little more wriggle room or when I purchase a new plant and need to take it out of the plastic pot it came in. You can tell if the plant is starting to be root-bound if you see roots starting to crawl out the holes in the bottom of the pot. I like to get a pot that gives my new plant about 2 inches of growth room around the whole diameter of the pot. This gives the plant room to grow but it’s still a bit snug. Replanting your sansevieria in too big of a pot means more soil, leading to more time to dry out, which can lead to root rot. Quick tip: The downside to using a terracotta pot is that because the pot lets the moisture breathe, the moisture will likely end up on the surface that your pot is on. If you have a pot on a wood floor or wood surface, it’s a good choice to place a plate or nonporous material under the pot as that’s the easiest way to protect the pot from ruining your surface. How Much Light Does a Snake Plant Need? The wonderful thing about sansevieria is that it can handle diverse lighting situations. The plant will grow better in bright light (indirect light near a window in your home), but it can handle a darker corner in your home with less light exposure as well. Low light is OK for the plant and it will be just fine in a room with low light. At my son’s school, there is an absolutely beautiful sansevieria in a room with no windows! The only light source is fluorescent light bulbs that are turned on during the day. It’s amazing to see this plant thrive in what appears to be poor lighting conditions. It truly is an incredibly adaptable plant! I have sansiervieras all over my home and each one is in a different lighting situation. The ones near the windows will definitely grow faster, but the ones in low light are still happy (just a little smaller). A rule of thumb when it comes to lighting: Just because they can live in some shade doesn’t mean that they will necessarily thrive in low light. They will definitely grow better in bright light. Watering I find the more I forget about my snake plant, the better! Only water when the soil is dry. I like to stick my finger in about 3-4 inches to check if the plant’s soil is completely dry. If there is a little moisture in the soil, then I will check it again in a week. How your plant holds moisture will depend on where you live. If you live in a dryer climate, then it will dry out faster, or if you live in a humid climate, then it will hold water longer. One tip that I have found to be vital is that I do not water my succulents or plants that like to dry out on rainy days. Watering on rainy days keeps my plants soggy and they take longer to dry out. Or, if there is rain in the forecast, I will wait to water until the rain is over. I water my sansevierias with more frequency in the growing season (which is spring to fall) so about every 2-3 weeks keeps them happy. In the fall-winter season, they only need a little water so I taper off and water about every 4 weeks. When watering, my rule of thumb is to just water the first 6 inches below the soil line. I don’t soak my plants with water because overwatering can cause soggy soil and lead to root rot. I’d rather under water than over water them. Sansevierias do not like their leaves to be wet, so when you water, just pour the water on the soil and try to avoid getting any water on the leaves. When new growth is coming in on sansevieria, little leaves form rosettes. These rosettes do not like getting wet and especially don’t like water pooling in them. Too much water in the rosettes can be detrimental to your plant, so try to avoid that at all costs. Sansevierias like room temperature water. If you are using tap/city water when you water, you can leave your tap water out in an open container for 24 hours so some of the chemicals evaporate. After 24 hours, the water is cleaner and healthier for our plant. Fluoride and chlorine can build up in your sansevieria, so this method of leaving your water out will pay off in the long run. Using filtered water or collected rain water is a great option too! Humidity These plants do well with the average humidity inside a house (between 30° and 50°) so you don’t usually have to do anything special to make them feel at home as far as humidity is concerned. Dusting Dusting the leaves is a wonderful habit that your sansevieria will thank you for. I grab a slightly damp cloth (not too wet!) and wipe the leaves down on both sides. This will help the sun hit the plant and not block photosynthesis from taking place. I turn my plant every time I water it. Turning your plant will promote even growth (especially if your plant is near a window). Another tip is to keep your windows nice and clean (on the inside and outside)! This can make a big difference with the amount of light getting to your plant. Squeaky clean windows will let in more light! Propagating Propagating a sansevieria is a fun and wonderful process to watch. You can propagate in water or in soil. I personally love propagating in water because you can see the new root growth happening before your eyes. If you’d like to propagate your sansevieria, simply cut off a leaf using a freshly washed tool. I find scissors are great! You can cut the leaf straight on the bottom or cut a “V” shape on the bottom. This “V” gives your plant more real estate to grow new roots. Grab a glass vase or jar and stick your newly cut leaf in it. I like to sill my water about 4 inches above the bottom of my freshly cut leaf. Keep your plant in the water and watch little roots start to sprout! Change the water and rinse the vessel anytime the water gets cloudy. I place my new cutting in front of a window so they can soak up lots of light. When the roots start to grow, you can leave the leaf in the water (I’ve left mine in water for months!) and it will do just fine. When the roots have sufficient growth (1-2 inches is great), you can pot it in soil! Super easy! If you want to propagate using the soil method, simply cut your plant (just like mentioned above) and stick your freshly cut plant into a pot with damp soil. As your plant begins to root (you can’t see it happening like the water method), you must make sure the soil doesn’t dry out too much. As the roots make their way out and grow, they will need constant contact with the soil, so don’t let your plant dry out too much when you are trying to propagate. I’ll check on my freshly propagated leaves and give them more attention than usual. If the soil has become bone dry, then I will give them a good soak in water. It is very satisfying when your new plant takes root and even begins growing new leaves! Lastly, one of the best things about sansevieria is the variety of species! This plant has a diverse and beautiful plant family. The classic and most popular plant is the sword-shaped leaf that you see EVERYWHERE (like in this post). Don’t be afraid to try new species because their care is very similar. Here are two different sansevieria I have in my home. It’s amazing how unique each one is! Other Species of Snake Plants This species is called Whale Fin (Dracaena masoniana). It looks like a whale’s fin breaching the water. I love how this plant stands alone. This one leaf is so dramatic and beautiful. Other leaves will eventually grow, but I love the way it looks right now! This species is called the The African Spear plant or Cylindrical Snake plant (Dracaena angolensi). It features a barb on the end of it’s more tubular shape and its leaves fan out and become quite large. I’ve had to separate this plant three times just because it grows so quickly! The Dracaena pearsonii variety is similar although that variety has succulent red-tinted leaves. There is also the cultivar Twist variety (Sansevieria trifasciata) which features twisted leaves, and Rhino Grass (Sansevieria desertii) which are plumper leaves that look resemble rhino horns. Another intriguing variety is the white-tinged snake plant Bantel’s Sensation (Sansevieria trifasciata) which boasts white vertical stripes up its leaves. The Moonglow (Dracaena trifasciata) variety has a light green color with a silvery hue (and no stripes) that’s very different for a plant-lover who wants a unique color. Troubleshooting Yellow or brown leaves: Leaves that are turning brown or yellow usually indicate either overwatering, pests, or root rot. Try watering less, treat the pests, and repot your plant to a slightly larger container if you can see that the roots are becoming too crowded. Pests: Spider mites, mealybugs, and thrips can be eliminated with neem oil and insecticidal soaps. Try rubbing alcohol for tackle scale insects and mealybugs."

Here you’ll find Snake Plant Care tips, including things good to know to keep yours growing. Snake Plants are some of the toughest plants you can find. Whether indoors, in your garden, or on your balcony, these spiky beauties can put up with almost anything. They’re easy to grow, but you should know a few things. Keep reading for Snake Plant care tips as a houseplant – you’ll see how low maintenance they really are.

This was taken just before I repotted my Sansevieria Zelanica. As you can see, 1 of the tough rhizomes had torn the side of the pot & new growth was emerging. Botanical Name: Dracaena spp & varieties (this plant has recently been reclassified from the Sansevieria genus to the Dracaena genus, but most still call them Sansevierias, so I will, too, for now). Common Name: Snake Plant, Mother-In-Law’s Tongue Everyone doesn’t swoon over these plants because of their strong, bold look and tough sword-like leaves. They’re definitely not the soft, “touchy-feely” kind of plants but certainly have character and interest and present quite the striking silhouette. Their modern, edgy feel appeals to me, along with how easy they are to care for. I now live in Tucson, Arizona, where I have them growing in my home and a couple in pots outside in the bright shade on my covered patio. The strong desert sun will fry them, but they handle the dry air like champs. These evergreen perennials are very long-lived, unlike some houseplants. If you’re looking for your own Snake Plant, many different species and varieties are on the market, with more new ones being introduced each year. You can find them tall or short, with round, flat, or concave leaves, and solid or variegated foliage with dark green, silver, light green, yellow, chartreuse, or white. My personal favorites are the old standbys Dracaena trifasciata and laurentii, zeylanica, cylindrica (this is the one they braid), moonshine, futura superba, jade, gold star, and bonsal. The latter three stay small and are suited for small spaces. Size Snake Plants grown as houseplants average in height from 8″ to 9′. My Sansevieria Zeylanica that you see in the image above is now over 5′ tall. You can buy them in 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14″ grow pots. Growth Rate Sansevierias are generally slow growers. They spread by underground stems called rhizomes which pop up as new growth. In stronger natural light, they’ll grow faster and slower in lower light. Uses They’re used as tabletop and narrow floor plants, as well as in dish gardens and kokedama. Snake Plant Care Guide Woman shown in her kitchen holding a clay pot with a snake plant, 4 additional snake plants sit on kitchen counter. A few of my new Snake Plant babies. Most will need to be repotted in a year or so. Light Requirements Even though Sansevierias prefer medium light (about 10′ away from the west or south window), they’ll also tolerate lower and higher light levels. How versatile they are! Just be sure to keep Snake Plants out of the direct, hot sun (not in a west or south window) because they’ll burn in a heartbeat. Indirect sunlight is their sweet spot. Note: In lower light conditions, the darker-leafed species and varieties ( like D. trifasciata & D. hanhnii jade) do better and are the ones you should buy. Snake Plants with brighter variegations will lose color and become less patterned in low light. Watering Easy does it with the watering frequency – this succulent plant doesn’t need it as much as many of your other houseplants. Be careful not to overdo it because too much water often leads to root rot. Always make sure the soil is almost completely dry before thoroughly watering again. So, if you travel or tend to ignore plants, this plant that thrives on infrequent watering is for you. How often should I water my Snake Plants? Good question! Water your Snake Plants every two-eight weeks. Your watering schedule will vary depending on your home’s environment, type of soil mix, and pot size. For instance, new plants in small pots will need watering more often than larger, established ones. I water my Snake Plants less often in the winter months (every five to seven weeks for those in large pots) when the temps are cooler, and the sun is less intense. This is the time of year when houseplants like to rest, and their growth slows. I water my small Snake Plants in 4″ pots every two weeks in summer and every two to three weeks in winter. Be sure not to let water build up in the center of the leaves (where they form a cup) because this can lead to a mushy plant and ultimately rot. You can read my Guide to Watering Indoor Plants to understand better how often to water. A large display of Snake Plants sitting on flagstone shelves at Berridge's Plant Nursery. Some many fun Snake Plants! I always love the displays at Berridge Nursery. Humidity Levels These plants don’t mind our homes and offices’ sometimes dry or stale air. They do fine with average household humidity levels. They’ll also do well in bathrooms where the humidity tends to be much higher and in my home in the desert where the levels are often low. Another versatility factor gives this houseplant the label: “diehard.” Temperature As I say regarding houseplants: if your house is comfortable temperature-wise for you, then your Snake Plants will do just fine. You want to avoid putting them in areas with cold or hot drafts. They tolerate a wide range of temperatures. I have a couple of pots growing outdoors (in the shade) that do fine. We get very hot here in the desert in the summer (110F), and a handful of evenings can dip below freezing in the winter. If yours is outdoors for the summer (make sure it’s protected from direct, full sun), know they don’t tolerate frost or snow. Get them indoors before the temperatures drop too low. Fertilizing Spring and summer are the best times to fertilize your plants. Early fall is fine, too, if you’re in a temperate climate. We have a long growing season here in Tucson from mid-February through October. I fertilize with Maxsea or Sea Grow, Grow Big, and Liquid Kelp seven times during the growing season. It’s how I feed all my tropical plants. I alternate using these granular and liquid fertilizers and don’t mix them. I feed them with a topping of worm compost and compost every two or three springs. I give them a light application of >worm compost with a light layer of compost over that. Easy does it – a 1/4 ” layer of each for a 6″ houseplant is fine. Snake Plants aren’t that needy, and fertilizing too often will do more harm than good. Depending on your climate zone, feeding two or three times a year may do it for your indoor plants. Whatever houseplant food you choose, don’t use more than the recommended amount because salts build up and can burn the plant’s roots. Combined with fertilizing too often, this will show up as brown spots on the leaves. You want to avoid fertilizing any stressed houseplant, i.e., bone dry or soaking wet. I don’t fertilize houseplants in late fall and winter because it’s not their active growing season. Close up of 2 types of tall snake plants sansevierias sit on a bench in a greenhouse. Mixed Sansevieria pots in the greenhouse at Rancho Soledad Nurseries. Soil Snake Plants are easygoing with their soil requirements. Because root rot is one of the main issues that kill these plants, I’d recommend using fast and well-draining soil to help prevent this. I use succulent and cactus mix combined with potting soil in a ratio of 1:1 for all of my Snake Plants. I make my own DIY Succulent & Cactus Mix, which I use for all my succulents indoors and outdoors. If whatever potting mix you’re using seems too heavy, add a few handfuls of pumice or perlite to up the ante on the aeration and drainage factor. This also is beneficial if the pot only has one or two smaller-sized drain holes. Repotting You don’t need to rush to repot your Snake Plants. They do better when slightly pot-bound. They have tough root systems, and I’ve seen quite a few that have broken their plastic grow pots. Yes, the rhizomes and roots are that tough. Generally, I repot mine every three to seven years at the most. If yours is in low light and not growing much, transplanting every five to ten years will probably be fine. It’ll certainly appreciate fresh soil mix at some point! Just make sure the potting mix you use is well-draining and there’s at least one drainage hole on the bottom of the pot so the excess water can flow out.

These are my little Snake Plants, “Moonshine & Futura Superba,” soon to be transplanted into larger pots. Here’s a post dedicated to repotting Snake Plants: Repotting Snake Plants: the Soil Mix to Use & How to Do it. Pests Snake Plants are relatively pest-resistant, but in poor conditions, they may occasionally attract mealybugs or spider mites. If yours gets mealybugs, I’ve got you covered with this post on How to Get Rid of Mealybugs on Plants. Here you can find info on Spider Mites Control. Regularly inspect your plant for any signs of infestation and treat accordingly using insecticidal soap, neem oil, or a DIY spray. It’s best to take action as soon as you see any pest because they multiply like crazy. Pests can travel from houseplant to houseplant fast, so make you get them under control as soon as you see them. Cleaning My Snake Plants don’t get dusty too often, but I take a damp cloth and wipe off the leaves when they do. It keeps them healthy and makes them look much snazzier. A collage of three pictures of snake plants, some are in yellow pots and green plastic pots, some are close up, and some are in white pots. Propagating Once you’ve got a Snake Plant, you may never need to buy another one. They’re very easy to propagate. When growing in the garden, they’ll propagate on their own as they spread by underground stems called rhizomes. As a houseplant, division followed by leaf cuttings are the easiest ways to get new Snake Plants. You can cut off healthy leaf-cuttings and place them in a loose soil mix until they establish roots. A faster way to propagate is by dividing or removing the offsets (pups, babies) from the mother plant. These can also be put in the same type of soil, and viola, you have a new plant! Check out these three ways to Propagate Sansevierias and this post on Propagating Snake Plants from Leaf Cuttings. Safe For Pets My cats have never chewed on my Sansevieras, indoors or out. The leaves are tough, so I imagine they’re less appealing than a crunchy Spider Plant. Snake Plants are mildly toxic to cats and dogs. I consult the ASPCA website for my info on this subject and see in what way the plant is toxic. Most houseplants are toxic to pets in some way. Regarding this topic, do a little more research and come to your own conclusion. Close up of the white flowers of a snake plant sansevieria. The sweetly scented flower of a Sansevieria,growing in my garden. Flowers Yes, they do but don’t hold your breath waiting for the flowers to appear when grown indoors. This occurrence is relatively infrequent and appears to be rather hit or miss. One of the varieties of Snake Plants growing in my garden in Santa Barbara would flower almost every year, but the others wouldn’t. The flower of a Snake Plant exhibits a pale whitish to greenish hue and emits a delightful, sweet fragrance. Snake Plant Care Video Guide Snake Plant Care FAQs Looking closely at the vibrant foliage of a sansevieria laurentii snake plant. The jazzy foliage of a Sansevieria Laurentii, 1 of the most widely sold Snake Plants.. Are you a beginning houseplant gardener? Be sure to put one or two Sansevieria plants on your want list. You’ll soon find out Snake Plant care is a breeze! Snake Plants make great office plants because they handle dry air better than most houseplants and don’t need much attention. I’ve seen this hardy plant in long planters at airports and office lobbies, tough environments indeed. If you’re looking for Snake Plants, a couple that might appeal to you Sansevieria Zeylanica and Sansevieria Laurentii. To Sum It Up: Snake Plants are virtually indestructible unless you have a heavy hand with the watering can or place them in a hot, sunny window. They seem to thrive on the dry air in our homes and neglect. The more you ignore them, the better they seem to do. I love Snake Plants because of their bold, architectural, sassy look. There are so many species and varieties to choose from. You’ll be hooked too! Happy gardening,"

Here I am with my 2 Spider Plants. The large one was grown from a pup (baby, spiderette, plantlet) brought from my Santa Barbara garden when I moved to Tucson 7 years ago. And yes, the tips of the babies are chewed off, thanks to my Tazzy. Kitties love those crunchy leaves – thank goodness they’re non-toxic! If you’re looking for a low-maintenance, beautiful houseplant that can thrive in various environments, you’ve come to the right place. Spider Plants are stunning with their cascading leaves and come in various leaf patterns and colors, mainly green, white, and chartreuse. These hanging plants need room to show off their arching displays as they grow. Those long stems, with babies and flowers along them, spray out any way they want to. Spider Plants aren’t everyone’s cup of tea, but I love their wackiness and somewhat wild growth habit. I grew them outdoors year-round when I lived in Santa Barbara, CA, in my side garden in pots in a bright, shaded spot. They’re as easy to care for outdoors as they are indoors. I’ve since moved to Tucson, AZ, and now grow mine indoors. This is about Spider Plant care as houseplants. If you’re “houseplant challenged,” Spider Plants might be for you. Here’s what you need to know about caring for these trailing plants whose arching leaves look like large blades of grass. Size The leaves of these plants are long. A large plant would be approximately 36″ wide x 20″ high, not including the babies. My larger one in a 12″ pot is 28″ wide x 22″ high. My smaller one in a 6″ pot is 19″ wide x 18″ high. They’re commonly sold in 4″ pots and 6, 8, and 10″ hanging pots. Growth Rate Moderate to fast, depending on the growing conditions. Uses Spider Plants make excellent hanging plants, especially if they have stems with babies, as it really shows them off. Smaller ones are fine as tabletop plants. I’ve also seen them in living walls. Spider Plant Care Tips Light Requirements Here’s where Spider Plants are most adaptable. They prefer nice bright light, near but not in a window unless it’s a north or east exposure. Being in a south or west window will cause the plant to sunburn, but near is fine. Whatever the exposure, make sure they’re not touching hot or cold glass. One of mine grows in the dining room, 3′ away from a west-facing window. The other grows in my office, hanging 2′ from a south-facing window. Even though bright, indirect light is their sweet spot, they’ll tolerate lower light conditions. Just know that some or all will revert to solid green if you have a type with variegated foliage. And those leaves will eventually become paler, weaker, and limp if the light is too low. They’ll do fine in strong artificial light. They probably won’t produce flowers and babies without natural light or in low-light conditions. You may have to move your Spider Plant to a brighter spot in the winter months so it gets the light it needs. Here are more tips on winter houseplant care. A collage with 3 photos of 3 different types of spider plants. As you see here, Spider Plants come in various leaf variegations. These are just a few & there are many on the market now. Watering Spider Plants have low to average water needs. Water yours when it’s dry or almost dry. Be sure to let the water drain through the pot, and if in a saucer, don’t let it sit in water. Depending on how warm and bright your house is, you’ll water every 10-21 days. I can’t tell you how often to water yours because many variables come into play. Here are a few: the pot size, the type of soil it’s planted in, the location where it’s growing, and your home’s environment. Here in Tucson, the climate is warm, sunny, and dry. I water my Spider Plant in a 12″ pot about every fourteen days in the summer and every twenty-one days in the winter. Mine in a 6″ pot gets watered every seven days in summer and every 14 days in winter. The thick rhizomatic roots of a Spider Plant store water. Don’t keep yours too wet, or it’ll succumb to root rot. It’s best if the bottom of the pot has one or more drainage holes. This allows the excess water to flow out. Consider using distilled water if your tap water is high in salts (Spider Plants are sensitive to minerals). I have a tankless r/o water filtration system in the kitchen with a cartridge that puts the good minerals back in. Interested in more on watering houseplants? Check out How to Water Indoor Plants. Temperature If your home is comfortable for you, it’ll be so for your indoor plants, too. Keep your Spider Plant from any cold drafts and away from direct air conditioning or heating vent blasts. Mine grew in my Santa Barbara garden (zone 10) year-round, and I can tell you that they grow in warm and cooler temperatures outdoors. Many spider plants with babies hang in a greenhouse. Plants hanging in the grower’s greenhouses. As you can see, the mother plant is not as brightly variegated as the Spider Plant babies (aka spiderettes, plantlets, or pups). Humidity These plants are native to subtropical and tropical regions. Even though they prefer humidity, they’re adaptable. They do fine in our homes, which tend to have dry air. The humidity here in the desert can be as low as 10%. Because of this, my Spider Plants have brown tips; otherwise, they look great. I have this humidity meter in my dining room close to the kitchen. It’s inexpensive but does the trick. I run my humidifiers when the humidity reads low, which is almost always in the Arizona desert! Every month or two, I take mine outdoors, give the foliage a good shower, and leave it in the shade for a few hours. It also helps to keep the foliage clean. If you think yours looks stressed due to lack of humidity, here are other things you can do. Fill the saucer your plant sits on with pebbles and water. Put it on the pebbles, but make sure the drain holes and/or the bottom of the pot aren’t submerged in water. Misting your plant a few times a week will help, too. I like this mister because it’s smaller, easy to hold, and uses a nice amount of spray. Fertilizing/Feeding Spring and summer are the best times to feed your houseplants. Early fall is fine if you’re in a temperate climate like me. We have a long growing season from mid-February through October in Tucson. I fertilize with Maxsea or Sea Grow, Grow Big, and Liquid Kelp seven times during the growing season. It’s how I feed all my tropical plants. I alternate using these granular and liquid fertilizers and don’t mix them. Spider Plants aren’t fussy or needy; fertilizing too often will do more harm than good. Depending on your climate and growing zone, feeding two or three times a year may do it for your indoor plants. Whatever houseplant food you choose, don’t use more than the recommended amount because minerals build up and can burn the plant’s roots. Spider Plants are sensitive to salt. Too much will show up as brown spots and/or brown tips on the leaves if you fertilize too often or use too high a ratio. You want to avoid fertilizing any stressed houseplant, i.e., bone dry or soaking wet. I don’t fertilize houseplants in late fall and winter because it’s not their active growing season. Every other spring, I give most of my houseplants a light application of worm compost with a light layer of compost. Easy does it – a 1/4 ” layer of each is enough for a 6″ houseplant. Read about my worm compost/compost feeding right here. A woman in a pink dress stands under spider plants with many babies in a greenhouse. This photo has nothing to do with Spider Plant care, but the spiderettes make a suitable headdress! Repotting Like fertilizing, spring, summer, and early fall are the best times to repot. Spider Plants like being a bit potbound, so don’t rush to repot yours unless it’s stressed and/or outgrowing the pot. Growing slightly tight in their pots will help them produce babies. When I repot Spider Plants (which isn’t too often), I generally go up one pot size for smaller plants and two sizes for large, mature plants. I last repotted one of mine five years ago, and it’s showing no signs of stress. The tuberous roots are tough and grow tight together, so you may have to work a bit to get it out of the pot by pressing on the sides and/or running a knife around the perimeter. Soil Mix Spider Plants aren’t too fussy regarding the soil mix. Use good organic potting soil labeled for houseplants or indoor plants. It must drain well and provide adequate aeration. The well-drained soil mix I use for mine is a blend of 1/3 potting soil, 1/3 coco coir, and 1/3 pumice. I toss in a couple of handfuls of a combo of worm compost and compost as I plant and top with a thin layer. Close up of many white & green variegated spider plant babies. Lots of beautiful spiderettes. Just a few stems have produced so many potential new plants! Don’t let too many babies hang on the mother plant for too long. Remove some of them because they’ll eventually zap out some of the energy from mama. Pruning This plant grows thick with foliage. I prune mine every couple of months to remove any yellowish undergrowth and bent and/or dead leaves. And, of course, to remove the stems with the baby Spider Plants for propagating! Just make sure your pruning tools are sharp before you do any pruning. Propagation Spider Plant babies are very easy to propagate. Simply cut the stem and remove the decent-sized baby. I wait until they’re at least 2-3″ in diameter with root nubs showing at the bottom. Often, there will be multiple babies on the stem, so you’ll get more than one new Spider Plant! The roots start as tiny brown nubs on the bottom of the spiderettes and turn whitish as they grow and elongate. The most popular way of propagating is in water. Put them in a jar or vase with water, and the roots will grow really fast. You don’t want water covering the foliage, just the roots. Change the water every 7-14 days so it stays fresh. You can plant them after 7-10 days or leave them in water much longer. I once left one in water for seven months, and it was fine. You can also put them in a light soil mix to root. Keep it evenly moist while rooting. Whether you’re propagating them in water or a mix, keeping them in bright light but out of direct sun is best. Another way to propagate them is by division. This can be challenging if the plant is older because those root balls are incredibly thick, dense, and fleshy. You could lose a portion of the plant and/or root ball in the process. A collage with 3 photos showing the roots of spider plant babies at different stages of rooting. You see a young baby on the left with little “root nubs.” As the baby grows (still attached to the mother), the roots grow also. On the right is a baby I’ve been rooting in water for a month. The roots looked like the image on the left before putting it in the water. It’s a fast process! Pests Mine have never been infested with any, but I’ve seen them with mealybugs and scale. I’ve heard they can also get aphids and spider mites. Identify these pests and treat your plant accordingly to get rid of them. Pests can travel from plant to plant fast and multiply practically overnight, so ensure you get them under control as soon as you spot them. Many people use neem oil to control these pests. I’ve been using this insecticidal super soap for two years with success. Spider Plant Flowers Oh yes, they do flower! They’re not particularly showy, nor are they fragrant, and are small and whitish. The star-shaped flowers appear as the plant ages. Close up photo of a young Spider plant bab. Spider Plant babies along the stem. Photo shows the white flowers on a spider plant. If you look closely, you can see a white flower. Pet Safety Are Spider Plants toxic to cats and dogs? Wave the flags! According to the ASPCA website, this one is deemed non-toxic. Just be aware that Spider Plant leaves are like crunchy grass. Fluffy or Fido might love munching away, making them sick. My kitty Tazzy occasionally chews on the ends of mine, so that’s another reason for pruning! Here are some of our houseplant guides you may find helpful: It grows the fastest in moderate to high light exposure. A bright spot shows off its arching nature and encourages flowering and the production of those small plantlets or babies a Spider Plant is known for. Spider Plants love bright natural light, but too much direct sun will cause burn. They’ll survive in lower light but won’t grow much. This can also cause the foliage to turn pale and weak. Like many indoor plants, a location with indirect sunlight is their sweet spot.No! I think they’re one of the toughest indoor plants around.Spider Plants can live a long time, well over 30 years. I knew a woman who had inherited her grandmother’s 40-year old+ Spider Plant. Nice to have a living memory of a beloved family member!No, they don’t. If they have many spiderettes attached, a hanging basket gives them more room to do their thing. They look better as a hanging plant because this shows off the arching leaves and sprays of babies. I would choose another indoor plant if you want one to grow upright. Spider Plants have long, arching leaves that look best displayed as is. Besides, they rarely get above 20-24″ tall.You can. Just know that if you leave too many babies on for too long and they get too mature, they’ll drain the energy out of the mother.It depends on many factors, so I can’t tell you. Yours might need to be watered more or less frequently than mine, depending on the pot size, the type of soil it’s planted in, the location where it’s growing, and your home’s environment. Keeping them on the dry side is better watering when the soil is almost dry. They have thick, fleshy roots that store water, so soggy soil is something they don’t like! Again, it depends on where you live. I’m in a climate with mild, sunny winters and water mine in a 12″ pot about every 21 days. I water my 6″ Spider Plant every 14 days. Yes, I do. A broken leaf will never grow back. Besides, Spider Plant foliage grows densely, so the plant will put out more leaves in no time.Most of our homes have low humidity at some time during the year. Brown leaf tips are most commonly caused by dry air. I don’t because I don’t like the look. You can if you’d like, but it will be an ongoing task!Yellow leaves on plants are commonly due to too much water, too little water, too much fertilizer, not enough light, or tap water too high in minerals. My Spider Plant is big and very full. Some low under leaves turn yellowish due to lack of light because the upper leaves crowd and shade them out.In no time at all! The roots are already poking out on the bottoms of the baby plants. The roots are well along after 7-14 days in water.When rooting in water, be sure to keep the water at a steady level. You don’t want it covering the foliage, just the roots. Change the water every 7-14 days so it stays fresh. If in soil, keep it evenly moist. It’s best to keep them in bright light but out of direct sun.n conclusion, Spider Plants are resilient, easy-care houseplants that are a wonderful addition to any home or office space. By following these care tips mentioned above, you can ensure that yours thrives and flourishes for years. Remember to provide bright, indirect sunlight for it to look its best and water when dry or almost dry."

Spider plants are moderately fast-growing plants. Their rosettes of slender, gently arching leaves stretch from around 12 to 18 inches long. The leaves are green or striped green and white. Mature plants regularly send out long stems that bear small, star-shaped flowers. If the flowers are fertilized, a small fruit forms. Once the flowers fall off, tiny plantlets form in their place, which ultimately grow their own roots and can be snipped off to create new potted plants. Common Names Spider plant, spider ivy, ribbon plant Botanical Name Chlorophytum comosum Family Asparagaceae Plant Type Herbaceous, perennial Mature Size 1–2 ft. tall and wide Sun Exposure Partial, shade Soil Type Loamy, well-drained Soil pH Neutral Bloom Time Spring, summer, fall, winter Flower Color White Hardiness Zones 9–11 (USDA) Native Area Africa Benefits of Spider Plant It is not surprising that spider plants are so popular, given their many benefits: Though they look great on a counter or tabletop, spider plants don't need to take up valuable space because you can grow them in a hanging basket. They require minimal care, which makes them ideal for beginners. They produce lots of new plants and are easy to propagate. Unlike many other popular houseplants, they are safe around pets. Spider Plant Care Here are the main care requirements for growing spider plants: Plant in moist, loamy soil with good drainage. Prefers to grow in light shade. Does well in containers Water and fertilize regularly throughout the growing season (spring to fall). Thrives in warm and humid conditions. frontal shot of a spider plant Credit: The Spruce / Krystal Slagle closeup of spider plant leaves closeup of spider plant soil Light Indoors, spider plants prefer a bright window or patio door that gets indirect sun. Outdoors, spider plants prefer to grow in light shade. They tolerate heavy shade, but their growth won't be as robust. Direct sunlight scorches the leaves. Soil These plants grow in a variety of soil types, but they favor loose, loamy soil with sharp drainage. Spider plant prefers a fairly neutral soil pH but tolerates slightly acidic to slightly alkaline soil. Water Spider plants like lightly moist but not soggy soil. If possible, use rainwater or distilled water as they can be sensitive to chlorine and fluoride. The fleshy tubers retain moisture well, so inconsistent watering, while not ideal, won't harm spider plants too much. In the winter, keep watering the plant regularly, as spider plant needs to be kept moist in all seasons. Consistent Watering Spider plants will bounce back from a bit of drought, but they prefer consistent moisture. Use a moisture meter to evaluate the soil, and water the plant just before the meter reads \"dry.\" Temperature and Humidity Spider plants need warm, humid conditions. They won't tolerate temperatures below 50°F and should be protected from drafts and air-conditioning vents. Try to maintain a humidity level of 50 to 60%, which is best achieved with a room humidifier. Fertilizer These plants like a moderate amount of feeding, roughly once a month during the active growing seasons of spring and summer. Too much fertilizer causes brown leaf tips, but too little fertilizer will result in weak growth.1 Use an all-purpose granular or water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season, following label instructions. Adjust the amount if necessary depending on your plant's growth. Don't fertilize the plant in the winter when it goes semi-dormant. Types of Spider Plant There are several varieties of spider plants, including: 'Variegatum' spider plant: This variegated variety of spider plant has leaves with wide stripes of dark green down the middle with white stripes along the sides. The width of each stripe is about the same. 'Vittatum' spider plant: Vittatum spider plant has a center strip of white that takes up most of the leaf. Small- to medium-sized green margins line each leaf. The stems of the leaves and plantlets are white. 'Bonnie' spider plant: Bonnie looks the most different from the other types of spider plant. It has a more compact size and the leaves curl loosely, sometimes even into large ringlets. The green leaves have creamy stripes down the center, but there's more of a gradient between the cream and green stripes. 'Ocean' spider plant: The 'Ocean' variety has green leaves with thin creamy edges. The plant's shorter, wider leaves give it the appearance of a spikier plant. Pruning Remove dead or browning leaves as they appear. If a plant is becoming too leggy and sparse, remove the plantlet shoots to redirect energy to the main plant. Pruning Tip Looking for the best pruners for your spider plant? We tested top-rated pruners in our Lab to make sure your plant stays happy and healthy. Spider Plant Propagation Spider plants are easy to propagate and so prolific that you'll want to share them with all your friends. One of the easiest ways to propagate them is by cutting off the plantlets and replanting them. Look for plantlets with roots. A mature spider plant getting enough light should send off offshoots (or plantlets) of what look like mini spider plants. Look for ones that have a growing root system at the base. Cut off plantlets. Using sharp pruners, carefully cut the plantlets off the stem, keeping the roots intact. Make the cut where the stem and the plantlet meet. Prep the pot(s). Prep as many small pots as you need (ideally terracotta ones) with a well-draining soil. The pots only need to be maybe 3 inches in diameter (one per plantlet). Moisten the soil. Place the plantlet in the new pot. Set the plantlet on top of the soil and then just barely cover the existing roots with soil. The roots will need to grow more to establish themselves. Keep soil moist. Within a few weeks, roots should develop. Spider plants can also be propagated by division. Unpot the entire plant and gently pull apart the root ball into sections, so you end up with several mature plants. Be careful to leave as many roots intact as possible. Then, replant the sections. Should You Cut the Babies Off a Spider Plant? It's up to you whether or not you want to cut the baby plantlets off a spider plant; however, it's probably a good idea to cut them off. Cutting the babies off a spider plant will help the plant focus its energy on caring for the mother plant and keep it looking good. How to Grow Spider Plant From Seed Seed propagation isn't very common, since spider plants are so easy to propagate vegetatively by planting the offsets or dividing the roots. You'll have much better luck propagating a spider plant than growing one from seed, but if you want to try, follow these steps. Cross-pollinate the plant. To produce viable seeds, spider plant flowers must first be cross-pollinated. Use a small artist's brush or cotton swab to brush across the individual blooms once they appear. Brush all the flowers to ensure the transmission of pollen to all blossoms. Harvest the seed pods. After the flowers fade, you'll find small green seed pods in their place. Pluck the dried pods from the plant and collect the seeds inside. Plant the seeds in soil. Plant the seeds about 1/2 inch deep in a small pot filled with potting mix, and keep the mix warm and moist until the seeds sprout. Fertility will vary, so plant a lot of seeds to ensure some success. Potting and Repotting Spider Plant Spider plants are often grown in containers as hanging plants due to the cascading nature of their foliage and their long stems with plantlets. In warm climates, spider plants do well in outdoor planters and as edging or ground cover plants. Grow spider plants in containers that are no more than 1/3 larger than the root ball. Ensure that the containers have ample drainage holes, and use a loose potting mix. Spider plants will typically need repotting every two to three years. You'll know it's time when you see roots protruding out of the drainage holes and up above the soil line. The best time to repot is in the spring. Gently remove the plant from its old container and position it at the same depth in a slightly bigger container. Then, fill around it with fresh potting mix. Keep watering the plant regularly, though, as spider plant needs to be kept moist during the dry winter months. Spider Plant Flowers Spider plants don't produce showy flowers, but if you want more flowers, give the plant a bit more light and make sure to regularly rotate it so all sides get even light. You can also try skipping repotting, as these plants seem more likely to bloom if they are slightly root-bound. Common Pests & Plant Diseases Spider plants are generally healthy, but they are susceptible to a few common plant pests, including aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites.2 Depreciated foliage is a common sign of an infestation. A natural and effective way to combat some infestations is simply to rinse the plant with water. If the infestation is severe, use an insecticide, or a natural remedy such as neem oil. Common Problems With Spider Plant Spider plants rarely cause serious problems, and those that do occur are usually quite easy to solve: Plant Is Too Sparse A possible remedy is to cut away some of the baby plantlets as this redirects the plant's energy into producing more shoots. Another solution may be to repot and divide a plant that has become overly root-bound. If your spider plant begins to suddenly struggle after months of being a healthy plant, it likely needs more room for its roots. Brown Leaf Tips Spider plants are among several types of houseplants that are especially sensitive to the chemicals or salts that are found in treated tap water, which may cause leaf tips to turn brown. If your plant begins to show these burned tips, it's best to shift to watering with collected rainwater or untreated bottled water. However, this is mostly an aesthetic issue. If you continue to water with tap water, you're unlikely to shorten your plant's lifespan. Leaf burn may also occur if a spider plant is getting too much direct sunlight. Remember that these plants prefer indirect light or shady conditions. Browning Leaves Too much fertilizer, an abundance of fluoride and chlorine in water, and overwatering leading to root rot can all cause browning leaves. Moreover, the leaf tips turn brown if the humidity is too low.1 Plants You Might Also Like closeup of spiderwort How to Grow and Care for Spiderwort Boston fern on an end table How to Grow and Care for Boston Fern cast iron plant How to Grow and Care for Cast Iron Plant dracaena marginata on a side table How to Grow and Care for Dragon Tree (Dracaena Marginata) Indoors 1 of 4 Spider Plants and Air Purification Spider plants were part of the NASA Clean Air study in 1989 that looked at the ability of plants to purify the air in an enclosed space.3 The study determined that an 1,800-square-foot home with 8-foot ceilings would need 70 spider plants—each in a one-gallon pot—to purify the air. However, it's worth remembering this is a home from 1989; the amount of VOCs may have increased or decreased in the average home since then. Regardless, there are better ways to purify the air in your home, such as with a quality air purifier. FAQ What is the best place to put a spider plant? The best place to put a spider plant is in or near an east-, west-, or south-facing window, with a sheer curtain between the plant and the window. Outdoors it grows well in a moderately shaded area. Does spider plant clean the indoor air? Yes, spider plants have been demonstrated to remove indoor pollutants such as formaldehyde from the air.4 However, you would need at least 25 spider plants in one small room to have even a moderate impact (by some estimates, as many as 700 plants would be needed to clean the air in a whole home). How long does a spider plant live? A spider plant that is well cared for and regularly repotted and divided can last for decades. They are often handed off from generation to generation. What are the challenges when growing spider plants? Two challenges of growing spider plants are the sprawling growth habit—the plantlets will shoot out in all directions—and its susceptibility to brown leaf tips. Browning leaf tips are typically caused by excess salts in soil or water, or too much sun. How often should you water a spider plant? How often you should water a spider plant depends on how much light it gets. In indirect light, a spider plant might only need watering every 10 days or so. In bright, indirect light, a spider plant might need water every five days. Let the soil dampness dictate when you water, not a calendar."

Spider plants like even moisture; they don’t like to be too dry or too wet. Keep plants in bright to moderate indirect sunlight. Spider plants do not appreciate direct, hot sunlight, which can burn their leaves, causing brown tips and spots. Spider plants grow fairly quickly and can easily become pot-bound. Plan to repot a spider plant about every other year. Spider plants can be grown outdoors as annuals during the summer. They look especially good along the edge of a container or bed, as long as they are kept out of direct sunlight. Growing During initial growth, water occasionally; once fully developed (within one year), water moderately. In the spring and summer months, keep the soil moist to encourage growth. Do not let the soil dry out too much. Maintain average room temperature and humidity. Spider plants prefer temperatures between 55° and 80°F (13° to 27°C), which makes them a great indoor houseplant. Fertilize twice a month in the spring and summer; however, avoid overfertilization. See more Houseplant Growing Tips. Spider plant hanging in a window Photo by Olga Prava/Shutterstock Types The most common varieties are the variegated forms: ‘Vittatum’ has green foliage with a single off-white stripe down the center of each leaf. ‘Variegatum’ is the inverse of ‘Vittatum’, with an off-white stripe running along the edge of each green leaf. Solid green varieties are also available. Harvesting Healthy spider plants may eventually produce pups, offshoots from the adult plant that can be removed and replanted to start new plants. For the best results, allow pups to reach approximately 2 inches in diameter before removing them from the mother plant. Alternatively, set the still-attached pups into pots of soil placed next to the mother plant. Once the pups have rooted themselves into the soil, they can be cut loose from the mother plant.

Find Out Why This One Simple Pruning Tip Can Help Rejuvenate Your Lavender One of the most satisfying summer pruning jobs involves getting your lavender in shape – so if you care about doing it right this summer, the 8-8-8 lavender rule is well worth a try. There are some gardening traditions that hold true even though they might seem a bit odd. Still, there are certain rules that stick in your head and acquire a certain status, even though you're not entirely sure where you first heard them. The 8-8-8 lavender rule is one such piece of advice told many years ago. And around this time every year, a little internal alarm goes off and the lavender bushes are inspected to assess next steps. But what is the 8-8-8 rule, and how can it help you maintain healthier, happier lavender shrubs and specimen plants? **What is the 8-8-8 Lavender Rule?** At its heart, the 8-8-8 rule – or the rule of three-eighths – is a pruning maxim. Quite simply, it is a moment in the pruning calendar to pull out snippers or shears, with a view to helping prepare lavender plants for the slower months ahead. Over early summer, many people will hopefully have been deadheading lavender plants to extend the flowering season. But the approach to the eighth day of the eighth month (8th August) is a chance to think about reducing lavender plants by at least 8 inches (depending on the size and overall condition of the plant). One variation, which seems fairly hardcore, is to reduce lavender plants so they are 8 inches (20cm) tall and 8 inches wide (again, allowing for size of plant). However, another variation involves reducing the size of the plant by approximately eight inches all the way around. This involves creating a more rounded, compact shape and removing tatty, leggy stems, dead branches and remaining flower stalks. The intention is to give lavender, whether potted or in garden beds or borders, the very best chance to slow down healthily on the approach to dormancy. **Why Does the 8-8-8 Rule Matter?** The lavender 8-8-8 rule provides a useful assist in determining a tidy-up operation – based on the idea that certain lavender flowers are starting to die back as August begins. It pinpoints a moment (after flowering, but before the fall) when it is good to prune lavender to allow it chance to rejuvenate and develop new growth before slowing down for the dormant period. Ideally, it's a good idea to give lavender plants at least a month to recover from that 'end of season' pruning before the colder months kick in. So the 8-8-8 rule for lavender matters as a barometer for formally marking the end of the flowering cycle, and welcoming in a quieter phase for growth generally, before the plants come to rest entirely. Making these important cuts now promotes a burst of new green growth which can establish before the plant starts to rest. It then wakes up next spring with the necessary foliage required to fire up the engines for the new flowering season. So this timely August prune is vital to helping the lavender 'stock up' on fresh supplies ahead of winter. That said, the 8-8-8 rule is taken as a guideline and a prompt, rather than a set of rigid principles. It can primarily be used with English lavender, based around flowering habit and flowering time (English tending to flower later than certain other types), but there will be variations depending on cultivar, weather, soil, and regional fluctuations. Some cues can be taken from the plant in question – such as, is it still flowering, or has it stopped? Does the plant generally look a bit straggly? Are there any purely woody lavender bits that haven't performed well over summer? This can all help make a decision about how to apply the 8-8-8 rule on a case-by-case basis. **How Rigid is the 8-8-8 Rule?** The way you apply the 8-8-8 rule for lavender plants will hinge on a few specifics, but the exact nature of both timing and amount still requires a measure of instinct and adjustment. For many, the big determining factor is whether or not lavender is indeed reaching the end of its particular flowering season. Some shrubs will seem to bloom all summer long. If lavender plants are still looking flush and vibrant, it wouldn't be wise to just start snipping out of some mechanical desire to follow the crowd. As with many tips, it's one you can adapt for your own situation. It is a valid checkpoint, though – a chance to inspect and assess, and formulate next steps. The 'hard pruning' style does favor English lavender varieties, which can bounce back impressively from extensive late summer snips. Within that broad category, there is plenty of variety in terms of plant shape and size. Plant age and growing conditions (and location) should also be factored in. Look at the color of the flowers – if they seem gray, that's the big clue. Pollinators will also tell you when the lavender's flowers are on the way out – by refusing to flit around in the same way. Appraise the overall shape and spread of the plant – is it becoming unwieldy or ungainly? Look out for legginess, and also gaps in the plant. Where there are opportunities to reduce weariness but also give the shape a lift, don't be afraid to use this rule to prompt a phase of targeted rejuvenation. **How to Prune with the 8-8-8 Rule** If you're satisfied that your lavender has stopped flowering, is mostly covered in faded blooms, looks leggy and seems to have collapsed into itself, your summer cutting is sure to be beneficial. Make sure your shears, secateurs and pruners are sharp. It would also be well worth using a measuring stick or measuring tape to check both the height and width of the plant. Again, some gardeners go in really hard with this haircut, and apply the 8-8-8 rule as leaving 8 inches rather than removing 8 inches. Look to remove 8 inches (or thereabouts) but only if confident that at least half the plant remained. Where making cuts, don't slice indiscriminately into the wood zone. Look closely and check along the branches. You don't want to cut into the woody part – unless it looks fairly lifeless, hasn't produced any green or bloom during the summer, and isn't adding anything to the overall shape. The ideal is to cut just above the area where the foliage begins. Along the length of woody stems, where you see blue-green nobs of color, cut just north of those. The result will hopefully be a smattering of foliage color, with significant reduction in plant scale and shape. You can use this opportunity to take lavender cuttings and start off your next generation in pots. Use shears for bulk cuts and pruners for targeted, precise cuts. Cut just above a node (where the foliage meets the stem) to give the best chance at healthy regeneration. Take your time, and treat this rule as a great chance to set the tone for next year's growth. You won't need to feed your lavender after pruning – just the usual watering, and you're done. When you aren't able to get to this rule in time, and you miss out on a late summer cut, it's best to wait until spring for a lighter prune – and resolve to go in hard at the end of next summer's flowering phase. --- ## **Article 2: How To Prune Lavender For Even More Heavenly-Scented Blooms** How To Prune Lavender For Even More Heavenly-Scented Blooms – Just Follow These 5 Simple Tips Pruning lavender at the right way is essential for promoting robust growth and prolific flowering. Here's how and when to do it for the best results. Lavender is a favorite herb for its pretty purple blooms and distinctive aroma. You can enjoy this perennial as a low border, hedge, or containers. But no matter where you grow it, knowing how and when to prune lavender is essential for healthy growth and an abundance of its prized fragrant foliage and flowers. Pruning is key to growing lavender plants that are healthy and full of blooms. If you don't prune plants regularly, they will become woody and produce fewer fragrant leaves and flowers. This simple guide will help you learn how to prune lavender properly for lush plants full of sweet-smelling blooms. **Benefits of Pruning Lavender** There are several important benefits to pruning and knowing how to prune lavender correctly: - Pruning prevents your lavender plants from becoming woody. - It keeps the growth and shape bushy and dense rather than leggy. - It promotes flowering and even reblooming later in the season. - Pruning keeps the plant healthier overall. - You can prune cuttings to propagate lavender plants and expand your garden for free. - Use clippings the same way as a regular lavender harvest. Put pruned stems into sachets and pop them into your drawers for sweet-scented clothes or towels. **When to Prune Lavender** Knowing when to prune plants is essential for getting all the benefits of this important garden task. Don't prune the first year that you plant your lavender. Plants need a year of growth to put energy into developing strong roots. If you prune now, plants will direct their energy into new leaves and flowers, which can weaken their roots and the overall plant long-term. Start trimming lavender plants during the second year they're in the ground and fully established. Spring is the best time to prune back your lavender plants. Wait for signs of new, green growth at the base of the plant before pruning. Also, wait for any danger of frost to pass. You can also do some light pruning after flowering. This can lead to a second set of blooms in the same growing season. Avoid pruning too late in the season, though—generally not after August. **How to Prune Lavender** **1. Use Sharp, Clean Pruners** When pruning lavender, it's important to start out with a sharp, clean set of pruning shears. Wipe down the blades of your pruning shears with rubbing alcohol or bleach to make sure all bacteria and potentially harmful germs are removed from the blades. **2. Make Clean-Up Cuts First** Remove any dead, damaged, or diseased branches to maintain the plant's overall health and appearance. You can do this kind of pruning at any time during the year since you are making cuts to clean up and keep your lavender healthy. **3. Follow the One-Third Rule** Trim back the healthy stems and branches by about one-third. This will force the lavender to create new and more growth, which will not only prevent lavender from becoming woody, but will also help to increase the amount of lavender available for harvest later in the season. Do not prune all the way down to the woody part of your plants. They won't regrow well after such a severe cut. Either follow the one-third rule or be sure the remaining stems are at least 4 to 6 inches (10-15 cm) long after pruning. **4. Always Cut Above a Node** When pruning lavender, make cuts just above a node to promote branching and bushy growth. A node is where the leaves attach to the stem. Avoid cutting into the woody part of the plants, as you might not get new growth from these cuts. Only cut the green parts of the plant. **5. Deadhead for More Blooms** You can help encourage a second bloom from your plants by deadheading lavender later in the season. Once flowers have bloomed, deadhead them and do some light trimming to encourage additional flowers. Stop pruning by August, though, to let plants get ready for dormancy and store up energy to help them bloom next year. --- ## **Article 3: 5 Types of Lavender to Grow for Fabulous Fragrance and Gorgeous Blooms** 5 Types of Lavender to Grow for Fabulous Fragrance and Gorgeous Blooms There are many types of lavender that suit certain areas or uses better than others. Explore the five main categories of lavender to see which is best for you. Many types of lavender are a useful addition to most any garden. As an ornamental, blooms serve as an invaluable asset to pollinators. Growing different types of lavender plants within herb or vegetable beds may also serve a great many purposes. Lavender has been praised for its use as a companion plant within vegetable gardens, and its purported ability to repel troublesome insects. Learning more about the different lavender varieties available to home gardeners can help those growing lavender for the first time select those which will thrive. **Different Types of Lavender** Though most within the genus are quite similar, there are over fifty different types of lavender plants. Commonly cultivated varieties are generally divided into one of several categories, depending upon their species. Each plant will vary slightly. Most often, these differences are related directly to requirements for growth and bloom period. Commonly used lavender varieties are divided into several categories, and learning more about each of their characteristics is useful. **Choosing the Right Type of Lavender** Though there are hundreds of lavender plant varieties available to gardeners, deciding which to grow can be difficult. While some species will only flourish under very specific conditions, others may be much more adaptable. Before planting, growers will need to consider their own garden spaces. This includes soil conditions, summer temperatures, and moisture levels throughout the growing season. It also depends what you will be doing with your lavender. Do you want it for a border plant, or are you looking for edible lavender for culinary use? With careful planning, gardeners are certain to enjoy gorgeous lavender blooms for many seasons to come. **English Lavender Varieties** Native to the Mediterranean, English lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) is commonly referred to by growers as \"true\" lavender. Varieties of English lavender are available in both large and compact forms. Most cultivars will begin blooming in early summer, producing immensely fragrant purple-blue flowers. When cooking with lavender, you should choose the English variety so your food doesn't end up tasting bitter or soapy. Their long stems are ideal for use in cut flower arrangements, dried bouquets, and craft projects. Some of the most useful varieties of English lavender include 'Hidcote' and 'Munstead.' **French Lavender Varieties** French types of lavender flowers are also quite popular. French and English lavenders are related, but French is better suited to warmer areas. Also known as Lavandula dentata, this species is ideal for use in pots, containers, and raised beds. French lavender is best grown in regions where winter temperatures remain moderate. Growers should expect plants to begin blooming in mid to late summer. French lavender seeds and plants are commonly available at local nurseries each spring. The 'Royal Crown' variety of French lavender is a compact shrub that is perfect for cottage gardens. **Spanish Lavender Varieties** Spanish lavender (Lavandula stoechas) is most common in warmer regions that experience prolonged periods of drought. This waterwise species is able to withstand the harshest of conditions without noticeable decrease in the number or quality of flowers. Disease-resistant plants are able to tolerate both heat and high humidity. Those who have grown Spanish lavender make special note of its unique, pine-like scent. The 'Royal Anouk' variety of Spanish lavender is a unique take on traditional lavender shrubs and is perfect for container gardening or landscape use. **Portuguese Lavender Varieties** Also known as Lavandula latifolia or spike lavender, evergreen cultivars of Portuguese lavender are praised for their immense ability to attract bees and other beneficial insects. Latifolia means \"broadleaf\" and you will notice that these varieties have much broader leaves than other types of lavender. They are ideal for use throughout the growing space, serving as an important companion plant. Tolerant to drought, Portuguese lavender plants are best suited to drier regions and those with warm summer temperatures. The spike lavender plants are particularly fragrant. **Lavandin Varieties** Lavandin plant (Lavandula x intermedia) varieties are a type of hybrid. In most instances, these plants are created by crossing English lavender with another species. Hybrid lavenders are celebrated for their robust growth habit and overall vigor. This includes resistance to disease and damage caused by common garden pests. These types are also among the most tolerant to cold. The 'Grosso' lavender variety is fairly common. Many lavandin varieties are considered to be the most fragrant of lavender plants. --- ## **Article 4: Can Lavender Grow In Shade?** Can Lavender Grow In Shade? Here's How To Grow Fragrant Flowering Plants Even In Partial Shade – Plus, Which Lavenders Are Best If your growing space isn't the sunniest, you may be wondering: can lavender grow in shade? We look at ways to cultivate this aromatic beauty in partial shade and filtered light. **Can lavender grow in shade? The short answer is – yes, and no.** The slightly longer (and hopefully more helpful) answer is that it will struggle in complete shade – but it does stand a very good chance of thriving in partial shade where certain other conditions are met. Making the most of lavender in shade relies on an understanding of what the plant needs, what your garden can provide, and how you can eke the most potential out of both, even when the sun seems elusive. It's also about being willing to keep on top of plant vitality and development, every day if necessary, and being able to think creatively and make adjustments where necessary. So if you're looking to grow lavender, even if you aren't blessed with an excess of natural direct light, these tips will help. Find out how to grow lavender in the shade – so it doesn't just survive, but goes on to flourish. **Will Lavender Grow in the Shade?** Growing lavender in shade – well, let's be honest, it's not ideal. These plants are native to the Mediterranean and their preferred way of being is to soak up the sun, every day. A generous intake of sunshine (at least eight hours a day) is massively beneficial in the development of strong stems and masses of vibrant flowers. A good source of light is also crucial in determining how aromatic your lavender plants will be. The more sunshine your plants receive, the more natural oils they will produce and the more potent their eventual fragrance will be. Of course, there are some variations depending on whether you are growing French or English lavenders, for example – but in the main, good light equates to stronger floral oils, which are essential for these quintessential cottage garden beauties. Lavender also relies on regular exposure to direct light to help regulate soil conditions – lavender plants don't like wet feet. As well as the primary issues of light deprivation, there are secondary issues relating to the quality of the earth in shady areas. Conditions are likely to be damper and cooler – an absolute anathema to lavender, which needs to be kept as dry and well drained as can be. If you stray from the light, you risk developing leggy plants that are starved of natural nutrients and lacking in vigor. So will lavender grow in shade? They certainly can't reach their full potential in total shade. However, it is possible to maintain healthy lavender in partial shade – as long as other elements of plant care are met, and certain ideas explored to their fullest. Here are a few easy ways to tip the balance in your favor where shade is an issue. **How to Grow Lavender in Shade** Now we've established the ideal growing conditions for lavender, and accepted that we need to compensate for a lack of light, here's the good news. While lavender plants generally prefer at least eight hours of sun a day, certain varieties can manage well on six hours where other care essentials are covered. Make sure you have given due attention to water, soil and warmth, and you're well on the way to vibrant lavender displays. If you're willing to adapt the way you grow your lavender, by thinking beyond conventional beds and borders, you'll greatly increase your chances. Incorporating elements like extra lighting or vertical gardening are all ways of beating the odds and preventing the painful sight of a dying lavender plant. Create a warm, dry environment where the growing medium is well draining, and you can still enjoy lavender in areas where diminished natural light is an issue. **1. Understanding your Garden** Before growing lavender in partial shade, it helps to understand how light changes in your entire garden – and not just over the course of one day. Ideally, you need to have a solid awareness of how light plays over several days with different weather, and at different times of year. It's not always possible to know this until you've seen your garden over the course of a year. But if you are pushed for time, you can learn a heck of a lot in a fortnight with the help of sunmapping. Sunmapping is about tracking natural light in a methodical and systematic way. By making a sun map, you can process the impact of simple domestic objects and gardening supports – like clothes lines, freestanding shelves, or a trellis – on your gardening space. It is an excellent way of identifying the extent of issues you may have overlooked, like fence line shadows or overhanging tree branches. Even making a simple decision like removing or cutting back a specific shrub can have a profound effect on light availability for sun-worshipping plants like lavenders. Every hour you can claw back can make the difference – so a full light audit is a great way of making those critical adjustments in an informed way. This is not just good for lavender planting, but for all manner of perennial flowers and shade plants. There are a few tools that can help determine the exact distribution and quality of sunlight in your garden. Some of the calculators and meters available can help you identify which parts of your garden are less or more conducive to healthier lavender growing. You may be surprised at what you find! **2. Select the Best Varieties** If you want to grow lavender for partial shade, one of the best ways to stack things in your favor is by choosing varieties with some affinity to trickier, less-ideal areas. French lavenders (Lavandula stoechas) and fernleaf lavenders (aka French lace lavenders) are best if you need something that is more shade tolerant. French and Spanish breeds (USDA zones 7 and above) are able to balance the light deficit against the support they receive from warmth, soil regulation, and good watering, especially if you grow your lavender in gravel-based or course-mix mediums. Conditional on some direct sunlight, you can also grow a couple of English lavenders in spots with partial shade – most notably, 'Munstead' and 'Hidcote'. Another great option for growing in partial shade is 'Phenomenal' lavender. This tough beauty has impressive resilience in less-than-great growing conditions, including damp and shade. **3. Grow Lavender in Containers** Where some shade is inevitable, another way to court success with your plants is being open to growing lavender in containers and being willing to move your pots around a little. Experiment with different parts of the garden, and don't be afraid to relocate containers if you feel like you missed the mark on your first attempt. This is the beauty of container gardening – the flexibility it gives you to change the growing position. You just have to make sure that whichever pot you use (and preferably this should be a stone or clay-based pot), the growing medium is well draining and features a strong mix of gravel and sand as well as potting soil. There's another key advantage to growing lavender in containers – it allows you to experiment with different elevations. Deploying vertical gardening allows you to raise pots to a level where they can access light they might not otherwise be able to enjoy. Raised walls and shelves can similarly be used to literally bring your lavender into the light. Impediments to natural light on the ground can be irrelevant where plants are raised above them, thereby creating better growing conditions: win-win! **4. Create Extra Light Sources** As well as using elevation to bring plants into the light, you can also boost natural light levels with a couple of sensible planting strategies on the ground. Where you are growing lavender in ground-based containers, make sure you place containers (and individual plants) at good spacings from other plants, particularly taller plants (which cast more shadows). Steps are great for containers, but try to avoid placing lavender on lower steps, as they will then be competing for light in a different way. Try to think about the 360-degree environment. As well as seeking to eliminate any barriers to light in the form of walls and so on, consider places where you can catch extra sunshine in multidirectional ways. For instance, think creatively by using windows or mirrors placed at strategic angles to capture reflected light. Finally, where you have the opportunity to increase light in artificial ways, embrace it. There are grow lights available that can help boost light levels, whether that's as part of a greenhouse culture, a balcony-based lavender planter, or something more adventurous that requires man-made light sources. **Frequently Asked Questions** **Can lavender grow in a north-facing garden?** North-facing gardens are a tricky ask for lavender lovers, since they aren't even likely to receive the minimum few hours of sunlight required to nurture the least fussy varieties. Ideally, you need at least some partial sunlight in your growing space, even for breeds like 'Munstead' and 'Hidcote'. North-facing spots are better serviced by really unfussy shade dwellers like hostas, hydrangeas and certain climbing roses. **Can lavender grow well under a tree?** Although a few lavenders have relative success when grown in partial shade, the last thing you want to do is deliberately compromise their chances. Lavenders are naturally more fragrant and more abundant in sun-soaked spots, so being forced into permanent shade under a tree is unlikely to result in attractive or healthy plants. Depending on the size and habit of your tree, of course, exposure to sun for part of the day could swing it in your favor. However, on the main, it is not recommended to plant deliberately where light will struggle.I'll fetch all five of those articles for you.Now fetching the second URL:Now fetching the third URL:Now fetching the fourth URL:Now fetching the fifth URL:Perfect!

Try This Expert Tip & Deadhead Lavender Plants For A Longer, Lovelier Flush of Flowers The heady rush of lavender is a feast for the senses, so make sure you can enjoy the show for as long as possible. Follow our tips on how to deadhead lavender for an extra hit of fragrant pleasures. The allure of lavender in a garden border or patio container cannot be overstated. Lavender flowers attract pollinators, and effortlessly add elegance and structure to low hedges and flower beds – and we all want those potent fragrant blooms to last for as long as possible. Knowing how to keep lavender blooming means you can enjoy the flowers for longer in the growing season – so if you've never bothered to deadhead lavender, this expert insight is going to transform your lavender enjoyment over summer. **Why Deadhead Lavender to Keep it Blooming?** The process of deadheading flowering plants is an important step in encouraging repeat flowering of your lavender. Removing spent flowers means the plant doesn't waste energy on them any longer. The process of removing them redirects the plant's energy into making more flowers. This is why deadheading can lead to repeat blooms, and it's something you can do for the duration of the flowering season. Deadheading is a process that works to promote continuing and repeat flowering on many types of plants, including all types of lavenders. Those that naturally repeat bloom, like Spanish lavenders, benefit the most. Deadheading is equally effective for lavenders in pots and in the ground. So if you're worried about a weary or faded lavender plant, or keen to keep your cottage garden classic bursting with blooms for longer, knowing how to deadhead lavender is your best chance for extended flowering. **When and How to Deadhead Lavender** So how do you deadhead lavender, and when? Timing is important for optimal deadheading. It depends on the type of lavender you have, and when it starts to bloom. But as a golden rule, the best time for removing lavender flowers is when they are fading. You can remove them before they are completely spent if you want to use the flowers. If not, remove them when all the flowers on a stem have faded. Start with a sharp, clean pair of shears, snips or pruners. A clean cut minimizes stress to the plant. Find spent stalks of flowers and make a cut just above the last set of leaves before the flowers. You should soon see new growth near the cuts, which will likely flower later in the season. Keep deadheading the lavender as needed, and as more flowers fade. They may not all fade at once, of course. Appraise your lavender plant every day, if you can. You cannot remove too many flowers. However, you can leave some on to go to seed if you want to collect the seeds for lavender propagation. **Deadheading versus Pruning** It's important to remember that deadheading isn't the same as pruning. Lavender pruning is also important for keeping your plants healthy, shapely and blooming. But they are implementing fresh growth in slightly different ways – one is prompting fresh blooming during the flowering season, while the other is helping you keep your overall plant in good shape ahead of the next dedicated season of growth. Prune your lavenders annually, beginning in the second year. You can do light pruning at any time, but you should save the most drastic shaping for fall, after the last flowering. Cut lavender bushes back by about one third. Just don't cut into the woody stems, as they won't regrow. **What Else You Should Do to Help Lavender** Knowing how and when to deadhead lavender is a great way to encourage repeat flowering, but overall good care is essential. If you want to get more flowers, consider the growing conditions and take steps to optimize them. For example, you can use a bloom-boosting fertilizer to promote flowering. Feeding lavender plants early in the growing season can help with flowering and also create stronger stems for developing flowerheads. Consider a potash-based feed, a diluted tomato feed, a seaweed-based supplement or a balanced flowering concentrate to help give flowers a little kickstart. However, it's important to avoid over-fertilizing lavender, as it can promote more foliage growth and fewer flowers. Too much overfeeding can also run the risk of root burn. It can even affect the intensity of the fragrance produced by the flowers. A little goes a long way. Make sure your lavenders are watered regularly, but that they never get soggy. The soil should drain very well to avoid standing water. They also need full sun to bloom, so always plant lavender seedlings, cuttings or young plants in areas where they will get six to eight hours of sunlight. **Which Lavender Varieties Flower for the Longest** It's important to choose lavender types that match your garden's climate and growing conditions. To maximize repeat flowering of lavenders, consider the types that bloom longer and have the potential to flower more than once in a season. Spanish lavender naturally blooms twice, or even three times, throughout the growing season. They bloom first in spring, again in summer, and sometimes, to a lesser degree, in fall. English and French lavender can be coaxed into reblooming with proper deadheading. Here are some examples of varieties that naturally bloom for longer: **Hidcote:** This English lavender has a long bloom period with a mounding shape. **Irene Doyle:** This is one example of an English lavender that naturally blooms twice per season. **Grosso:** This French lavender is a larger lavender bush and produces a longer-lasting bloom period than other types. **Goodwin Creek Grey:** This French lavender has an exceptionally long bloom period, from early summer right through early fall. It's best for warmer climates, though. **Frequently Asked Questions** **How Long Does Lavender Flower?** Bloom timing and duration depend on the type of lavender. You can plant different lavenders strategically to extend the bloom time. English lavender blooms in midsummer for three to four weeks. Spanish lavender blooms earlier, in spring, and often again in summer. French lavender will bloom most of the summer and into the fall in warm climates. **Does Lavender Flower Less Every Year?** Lavender bushes are some of the best perennials for flowering well every year. The key is to give them the right care. Longevity may vary slightly depending on soil or container conditions, weather, region and lavender variety. But if you follow any planting and care instructions closely, they can last for 15 years or more in the right conditions. **How Do I Perk up Lavender with No Flowers?** If your lavender isn't blooming, consider the growing conditions. To flower, you need the right lavender type for your climate. Lavender also needs full sunlight to bloom. The soil should be light and drain very well. Perhaps most importantly, you need to prune your lavender regularly. If you don't, it will grow woodier and may stop flowering. --- ## **Article 2: How To Propagate Lavender: Rooting Lavender Cuttings** How To Propagate Lavender: Easiest Ways To Grow More Of These Fragrant Flowering Herbs Lavender is a great favorite of herb growers and learning how to propagate lavender lets you fill your garden with more of these beautiful, fragrant plants. If you've ever grown lavender, you've probably wondered how to grow more of these delightfully fragrant flowers for free. Thankfully, learning how to propagate lavender plants is as easy as growing these lovely, low-maintenance perennials. Growing lavender is quite popular. Not only do lavender plants look gorgeous in the garden, but the leaves and flowers of lavender plants are renowned for their fragrance and uses in food, beauty, and medicinal products. It's no wonder why you might want to propagate and grow more of these amazing plants. **Best Ways to Propagate Lavender** There are several ways to propagate lavender. You can propagate lavender from seed or divide lavender plants, though division is nearly impossible since lavender is a woody subshrub type herb. If you're looking for a quick and easy way to grow more lavender plants for free, there are three basic methods that work best: **Softwood Cuttings** The process of propagating softwood cuttings generally refers to taking small segments of new plant growth, or that which has just begun to mature. You can take this type of cutting from lavender plants in the spring and they will yield dependably good results. If you take cuttings early in the growing season, that allows ample time for each one to begin to root. Then you can pot out new lavender plants into individual containers. You can continue to grow lavender in pots from your softwood cuttings or transplant lavender plants to an in-ground garden. **Hardwood Cuttings** Gardeners also find success growing lavender from hardwood cuttings. Hardwood stem segments are usually taken much later in the season, from mid-summer until fall. This is often ideal as more mature and woody lavender plants require a longer period for root development and establishment while outdoor conditions are cool. **Layering** Propagation by layering occurs by stretching or bending a living plant's branches towards the ground and covering a small portion of the branch or stem with soil. Over time, leaf nodes in contact with the soil begin to grow roots. You can propagate lavender easily this way. Branches with young shoots are the best candidates for layering, provided that soils are kept consistently moist throughout the entire season. **Best Time to Propagate Lavender** The best time to propagate lavender depends upon the technique. Propagating semi-hardwood cuttings, which includes softwood cuttings, is best done in the spring. They are much more likely to root at this time. When rooting cuttings from lavender stems that are more mature, such as from hardwood cuttings, that's better done later in the season. This allows new plants to overwinter as roots develop. **How to Propagate Lavender from Cuttings** One of the most popular and easiest ways to propagate lavender is by cuttings. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you grow more lavender from cuttings: **1. Take Cuttings** Take cuttings of lavender by removing 6-8 inch (15-20 cm) long stems from the plant. Make each cut just below the nearest set of healthy leaves, at a 45-degree angle, the same way you would when pruning lavender plants. While softwood cuttings should consist of fresher, green growth, those taken for hardwood propagation should be much more mature. **2. Trim Off Leaves** After taking cuttings, each piece needs to be properly prepared. This begins by stripping or removing any excess leaves from the stem. Remove any leaves that will be covered by soil as well, leaving only 1 to 2 sets of leaves at the top of each cutting. **3. Plant Cuttings** Next, it's time to plant your cuttings. If you like, you can first dip prepared cuttings into rooting hormone. Though this is not required, many find that the use of hormones aids in the rapid production of roots and helps improve your chances of success. Plant cuttings into a well-draining potting mix in pots or seedling trays. You can make a hole first with a pencil or your finger, or you can gently push cuttings into the soil. Gently firm soil around the cuttings so they stand upright. **4. Water and Keep Moist** Once planted, water new lavender cuttings well. Throughout the rooting period, consistent moisture and humidity are key in encouraging root growth. You can mist cuttings with water to increase humidity around them or use a humidity dome or greenhouse to ensure conditions for rooting are ideal. An easy way to increase humidity is to place a plastic baggie over top of your cuttings. If you're looking to propagate a lot of plants, a good idea is to invest in a specially designed humidity dome. **How to Propagate Lavender by Layering** To begin layering lavender plants, first select the stems you want to use. Near the base of the plant, dig a small trench. Carefully, bend the lavender to the ground and cover the prepared leaf nodes with soil. Water newly layered plants well and make certain they receive consistent moisture throughout the season to help them root and grow. **Frequently Asked Questions** **Can You Root Lavender Cuttings in Water?** Though it is possible to propagate lavender and root other herbs in water, rates of success may be unpredictable. Since many species of lavender are susceptible to rot, keeping each cutting healthy throughout the process can be difficult. If you plan to try this technique, prepare your cuttings the same way you would for soil propagation and then place them in a glass of water. Replace water every other day to keep it clean and prevent rotting. **Can You Plant Lavender Cuttings Straight into the Ground?** Lavender cuttings can also be placed directly into the ground. However, conditions in the garden require closer monitoring to avoid the loss of cuttings. This includes careful attention to drainage, soil moisture levels, the potential for weed pressure, and damage caused by insects or browsing animals. Rooting lavender cuttings in container first is your best bet for success. --- ## **Article 3: How To Revive Dying Lavender Plants** How To Revive Dying Lavender Plants Overwatering, over-pruning, and inadequate sun are the most common reasons for lavender dying. Let us take you through how to prevent it... and fix it! Lavender (Lavandula) is a beautiful, aromatic plant native to the Mediterranean which many gardeners incorporate into their landscape, sometimes with dismaying results. If you notice your lavender plants dying, you're probably wondering why and how to revive lavender. **Why is My Lavender Plant Dying?** If you've noticed your lavender plant is looking a bit peaked, the first order of business is to identify the cause. Lavender plants can be a bit persnickety. For one thing they require well-draining soil with a pH of 6 to 8. A soil test will help to determine if the pH needs adjusting. To raise pH, amend the soil with limestone. As lavender hails from the Mediterranean, this plant needs plenty of sun; six to eight hours per day. New plants are not yet able to tolerate the heat, however, so plant them in early to mid-spring so they have time to acclimate before the hot temps of summer. Also, some people may think their lavender plant is dying when in fact it is dormant. Dormancy happens when temps cool and sunlight is less available. Dead lavender will have no sign of green but instead the branches will be brown and hollow. Temperature is another reason why your lavender plant may be dying. Snow doesn't affect mature lavender plants, but chilly temps will. Mature lavender tolerates lows of 10 degrees F. (-12 C.); however, newly planted lavenders may succumb to temps below 40 degrees F. (4 C.) at night. **Lavender in Pots Dying** Growing lavender in pots has its own set of special considerations. If you have lavender in pots dying it may be because the plant is over or underwatered, the soil is inconsistent with the plant's needs, the plant is too little, getting too much sunlight, or the plant may need to be fertilized. Again, cold temperatures may affect potted lavender. It is a good idea to protect potted lavender when temperatures dip by moving the plant into a garage, covering the plant, or mulching heavily. Both potted lavender and those in the earth can be affected by over or underwatering. Overwatered lavender may have yellowing leaves, initially on the lower leaves. Drooping, a rotting odor, and of course sodden soil are also indicators of an overwatered lavender dying. Underwatered lavender will droop and the soil will feel completely dried out. To correctly water potted lavender, soak the soil well and then allow the top inch (2.5 cm.) to dry out completely before watering again. **Additional Reasons for a Dying Lavender Plant** Root rot is a common problem caused by overwatering that results in a lavender plant dying. If you suspect root rot you must act quickly to save the plant. Remove the plant from the soil and prune off any affected roots. Then replant the lavender in well-draining soil. Insects can also cause a lavender plant to die. Spittlebugs and froghoppers both suck the sap from plants. You can detect them by observing the white, frothy blobs that appear on the stems and leaves of infested plants. The four-lined plant bug (FLPB) is another sucking insect that feeds on new leaves and stems from late May to early July. Infested leaves end up being spotted with uniform white or gray dots. Generally, the damage done here is more ornamental than deadly. Disease can also affect lavender. Septoria leaf spot is caused by a fungus that weakens plants in the late summer to early fall. It is fostered by humid, wet conditions. Another symptom of Septoria leaf spot is round spots on the leaves. This fungal disease is spread by wind. Lavender shab is another fungal disease which results in twisted, brown stems along with tiny black dots on the stem. This disease is easily transmitted so pull out infected plants and destroy them. **How to Revive Lavender** - If root rot is suspected, prune out infected roots and replant the lavender in well-draining soil. - Be sure your lavender, potted or otherwise, receives six to eight hours of sun. - Water deeply but wait until the top inch (2.5 cm.) of the soil is dry until watering again. Use a soaker hose or water at the base of the plant to keep the foliage dry to minimize fungal disease. - Lavender naturally becomes leggy with open, woody regions at the center of the plant. Prune lavender back the plant by one third to one half before new growth starts. - Test your soil. The ideal pH for lavender is 6 to 8. Amend with limestone to raise the pH. **Best Aftercare For Revived Lavender** Those who have successfully saved dying lavender plants should continue care until they have retained vigor. This means moving each plant, if possible, to a sheltered location where it is able to recover for several weeks. During this time, moisture and light levels should be monitored carefully. This will help to prevent the lavender from becoming too stressed as it regains its strength. **Frequently Asked Questions** **What Does Dead Lavender Look Like?** It's hard to distinguish between dormant and dead lavender plants. Though dormant plants will take on a woody appearance throughout winter, growth should resume with the arrival of warmer temperatures in the spring. Plants that have died will not produce green growth and will retain their browned, brittle appearance. **Can You Revive a Dead Lavender Plant?** If your lavender is truly dead, very little can be done in an attempt to revive it. You can, however, lift the plant from the soil in order to inspect its root system. Doing so can help to confirm suspicions as to whether or not it has died or will resume growth in spring. --- ## **Article 4: When To Plant Lavender For Happier And Healthier Plants** When To Plant Lavender For Happier And Healthier Plants Guaranteed! You may be surprised to learn that the best times to plant lavender seeds are the cooler months. Knowing when to plant lavender correctly gives these fragrant herbs the best start, as this guide explains. Knowing when to plant lavender, both as seeds and as plants, is key to longevity. With so many positive attributes, it's easy to understand why gardeners become interested in growing lavender in their backyards and gardens. Lavender has long been praised for its usefulness in the herb garden. Planted traditionally for its ability to calm and soothe, lavender buds are also popular when used culinarily. Lavender flowers add further appeal around the home through crafting ideas like scented sachets, wreaths and floral arrangements. Learning more about lavender seeds and what they require for growth can help improve healthy and fragrant lavender plantings. Here we show you how to master the timings for better lavender health, beauty and fragrance. **When to Plant Lavender Seeds** While many types of flower seed germinate readily, lavender germination time is known to be quite long. It is not uncommon for this process to take up to a month or more. So knowing when to plant lavender seeds involves an element of working backwards from an anticipated germination point. As a seasoned grower, I suggest growing lavender plants from seeds indoors or using other germination methods rather than sowing them directly into the garden. If you do choose to start the seeds indoors, do so in late winter to allow for ample germination time and a long establishment period before moving the new seedlings to the garden. The lavender type will be a contributing factor to when you plant. When it comes to growing English lavender, when to plant may be debatable, as some gardeners prefer sowing seed later in the year. **Can You Plant Lavender in the Fall?** Lavender can definitely be planted in the fall. However, there are a few special considerations to note. If you want to start lavender in the fall, begin the process around eight-10 weeks before the arrival of the first average frost date. This will allow time for the seeds to germinate and put on new growth before being moved into the garden. If you live in a region with milder winter weather, you have more flexibility within this timeline. In general, the best time to move lavender outside is when temperatures are still cool. During this period, the seedlings will continue to establish new roots. This is essential to ensure that they can withstand conditions in the garden during their first year of growth. You may decide to sow your seedlings in winter. This method is good for making use of recycled materials to create miniature outdoor greenhouses. Winter sowing is often the best option for beginner gardeners or those who lack experience in starting seeds indoors. **Transplanting Lavender Seedlings** Before moving your lavender seedlings outdoors, they need to be properly hardened off to avoid added stress or complete loss of the plants. This needs to be factored in when you are deciding the best time to transplant lavender – either into the ground or a larger container outdoors. As a general rule, you can move a lavender plant any time between early spring and early summer. Along with knowing when to plant lavender, the choice of planting material can influence growth and fragrance. Lavender planting beds should drain well. We recommend planting sites with sandier soil. Ample sun throughout the day is also imperative for the production of high-quality flowers. **Frequently Asked Questions** **How Long Does Lavender Take To Grow?** Though some varieties of lavender are known to grow much more quickly than others, it's not likely that growers will see flowers in the first season after sowing seed. On average, it takes approximately three years before the plants can mature and start to produce flowers dependably. **How Long Does Lavender Live For?** Though they are perennials, lavender plants are relatively short-lived. On average, you can expect mature lavender to maintain good health for an average of 10 years. --- ## **Article 5: Lavender Container Care: Tips On Growing Lavender In Pots** Lavender Container Care: Tips On Growing Lavender In Pots Lavender is loved by herb growers and flower farmers for its delicate aromatic fragrance and soothing properties. In addition to its relaxing properties when ingested, lavender is used in soaps, cosmetics, and is purportedly able to repel insects within companion planting. Lavender has a stellar reputation as a perennial herb, whether grown in the garden or in a pot. While it can be hardy and prolific, lavender requires specific cultural conditions to thrive. If you're wondering how to grow lavender in pots and containers, learn more here about how. **Can Lavender Grow in Pots?** Lavender is a good choice for container growing. Growing lavender in pots may be especially helpful for gardeners with unsuitable soil conditions or limited access to green space. Containerized lavender also allows for moving the plant when weather conditions become too harsh, and it can be winterized indoors, such as in a basement. Lavender pots need to be large enough for the soil to insulate the plants' roots and still drain easily. Lavender in planters also makes an attractive addition to the landscape, adding both color and scent near porches or patios. Despite their adaptability, to grow potted lavender plants it's important to consider several specific points related to their care. **Starting Lavender Plants** Lavender can be grown from seed or from cuttings. Seeds should be placed on top of sandy soil and can be covered lightly with a layer of perlite. The planted seeds should be kept warm until they sprout, even using a warming mat if necessary. Cuttings should be taken from existing plants just below a node where a set of leaves join the stem. Dip them in root hormone, and insert into warm, moist, sandy soil. No matter how you start your container grown lavender plants, it's important to choose the right potting mix. Lavender doesn't like to be damp, but it does need water. This means good drainage is essential to lavender container care. If the pot you choose doesn't have plenty of drainage holes in the bottom, drill a few more. If you plan on keeping the pot inside, you'll need a saucer to catch the water, but avoid choosing pots with saucers attached to the bottom. Lavender cannot stand wet feet. Choose a sandy, alkaline, well-draining potting mix with slow-release fertilizer pellets. **How to Care for Lavender Plants in Pots** Before planting, you should decide which variety to plant. While most cultivars will perform well in pots, it's important to consider the plant's size at maturity relative to the container. Dwarf varieties of lavender are ideal, as they often require less time dedicated to their maintenance, and will seldom outgrow their pot. Lavender plants like heat, and many varieties won't survive a cold winter, so planning ahead for how and where to situate your pots or other containers is helpful. **Best Soil for Lavender in Pots** Growing lavender in containers requires special attention to soil. Though it is possible to grow lavender in a quality potting soil, proper drainage is key in making certain the plants will be able to thrive. Experts suggest filling lavender containers with a mixture of compost, sand and/or gravel for the best results. Adding lime at planting time may also be helpful as a means to raise the pH level of the soil, which should be only slightly alkaline. **Water Requirements** Lavender is native to the Mediterranean region of Europe where it's warm and somewhat dry. Established lavender plants prefer soil that is allowed to dry between each watering. Since containers are known to dry quickly, plan for daily or weekly irrigation. This is especially true in regions that are hot or experience sparse rainfall throughout the growing season. Be sure to avoid wetting the leaves or foliage when watering containerized lavender. Most importantly, never let the plant sit in water, and don't overwater. Well-draining soil, like what's found its natural habitat, will lend longevity to the plant. **Light Requirements** Potted plants should be situated where they can receive 6 to 8 hours of direct light each day. Indoors, a south-facing window works best and a containerized lavender plant might appreciate a grow light if natural light isn't sufficient. In any case, the more bright warm light the plant receives, the more it will flower. Indoors, the plant enjoys temperatures between 60 to 70 degrees during the day, and it does not appreciate drafty or humid conditions. **Pruning Lavender in a Container** Pruning lavender to help maintain the desired size and shape of the plants will also promote flowering. Trim back new growth in early spring, making certain to avoid the woody parts of each stem. Dead or damaged stems can also be removed at this time. You can do some additional pruning of lavender plants in the summer after the plants have finished blooming. Deadheading after the first flush of flowers can help to encourage repeat blooming and promote new, bushier growth. **Best Lavender for Pots** Some varieties of lavender work well in pots and thrive if properly cared for. English lavender tends to be more cold-hardy. Dwarf varieties are great in pots. Here's a list of just a few kinds of lavender that do well in containers: - Dwarf Munstead English Lavender - Lacy Frills English Lavender - Provence French Lavender - Thumbelina Leigh English Lavender - Wee One English Lavender - Anouk Spanish Lavender Your local garden center can advise you on the best cultivars for your climate, or contact your area's local extension service for more specific information on which types of lavender are best for your region.I'll fetch all six of those articles for you.Now fetching the second URL:Now fetching the third URL:Now fetching the fourth URL:Now fetching the fifth URL:Now fetching the sixth URL:Perfect! Here's all the text from the six articles: --- ## **Article 1: What Are The Best Plants To Grow With Lavender** What Are The Best Plants To Grow With Lavender Companion planting is an easy and very effective way to make your garden the best it can be. It draws on a few different principles, like pairing plants that repel insects with those that suffer from them, and matching water and fertilizer needs. Lavender does have some specific requirements that mean it can only be planted in certain parts of the garden, but it's also very good at protecting other plants from pests. **Lavender Plant Companions** Lavender is very particular in its growing requirements. It needs full sun, little water, and little to no fertilizer. It's usually happiest if left alone. This means that if you place it next to a plant that prefers more attention, one of them is going to suffer. Some good plants to grow with lavender which share similar needs are: - Echinacea - Aster - Sedum - Wild indigo - Baby's breath - Drought tolerant roses These companions for lavender perform well in full sun and dry, less-than-rich soil. Gazania, another good choice, is a beautiful flowering plant from South Africa that fares especially well in poor, dry soils. Like lavender, it will really suffer if you pay too much attention to it. On top of being good companions for lavender based on their growing habits, these plants all also produce flowers that pair strikingly with its purple blossoms. Some planting companions for lavender benefit greatly from having it nearby. Lavender is a natural repellant of moths, slugs, and deer. Any plants that suffer from these pests will benefit from having a lavender plant nearby. Fruit trees, in particular, which can be hit very hard by moths, tend to do much better when surrounded by lavender bushes. The same can be said for cabbage and broccoli, which often fall prey to slugs. --- ## **Article 2: Lavender Seed Propagation – How To Plant Lavender Seeds** Lavender Seed Propagation – How To Plant Lavender Seeds Growing lavender plants from seed can be a rewarding and fun way to add this fragrant herb to your garden. Lavender seeds are slow to germinate, and plants grown from them may not flower in the first year, but if you're patient and willing to put in the work, you can generate beautiful plants from seeds. **Germinating Lavender Seeds** The first step in lavender seed propagation is choosing a variety and germinating the seeds. Be aware that not all cultivars will come true when you propagate by seed. If you are determined to grow a particular cultivar, you're better off using cuttings or divisions to get new plants. Some good varieties for starting by seed are Lavender Lady and Munstead. It can take one to three months for lavender seeds to germinate, so start early and be patient. Also, be prepared to germinate them indoors. Lavender seeds will need warm temperatures, between 65 and 70 degrees F. (18-21 C.). If you don't have a warm spot or a greenhouse, use a heat mat to keep your seeds warm enough. **How to Plant Lavender Seeds** Use shallow seed trays and just barely cover the seeds with soil. Use a light soil or a vermiculite blend. Keep the seeds moist but not overly wet. A sunny spot is a great location to keep the soil from getting too wet and to add warmth. Your lavender seedlings will be ready to transplant once they have several leaves per plant. Your first year of growth will not be impressive, but by year two, expect to have large, blooming lavender. Starting lavender plants from seed is not difficult, but does require time, some patience, and a little extra space for your seed trays. --- ## **Article 3: Lavender Plant Division: Can Lavender Plants Be Divided** Lavender Plant Division: Can Lavender Plants Be Divided If you're reading this, it means you have an interest in dividing lavender plants. Anyone who has smelled the floral sweet scent of lavender would obviously want to make more of these glorious plants, right? The burning question is, however, \"Can lavender plants be divided? The answer is, \"it's kind of complicated.\" **Can Lavender Plants be Divided?** Professional lavender growers generally respond that lavender is a sub-shrub and, hence, can't be divided. Lavender plants are a typical sub-shrub in that they only have a single stem and root system. Branches grow forth from this main stem just above ground level. Lavender plant division performed on the roots of a plant with only one main stem results in a high plant mortality rate, so it is strongly advised against. It not only has the propensity to kill but is the hardest way to propagate lavender plants. Seed, layering, or cuttings are much easier methods and don't risk plant vitality. Cuttings are the most popular method of lavender propagation. However, if you're going to buck the advice not to do it and attempt division anyways, the best candidate would be a lavender plant which has exhibited a decrease in flower production over a 2+ year time frame, or one which is dying from the center out. As for when to split up lavender, the ideal time would be fall or spring. In summary, lavender plant division performed in this way is for the gardener who thrives on doing things the hard way and embraces challenges. **How to Divide Lavender** There is a roundabout way of dividing lavender – but only on multi-stemmed plants. Woody perennials, such as lavender, sometimes propagate themselves by forming new plants when one of their branches makes contact with the ground and forms roots. You can create new independent plants from these layered stems by using a sharp sterile knife to cut between the rooted stem and the original plant, then digging up the new plant and planting it elsewhere. This is a type of division nonetheless. --- ## **Article 4: Lavender Plant Care: Reasons For Drooping Lavender Plants** Lavender Plant Care: Reasons For Drooping Lavender Plants Whether in the garden or containers, lavender is a fabulous plant to have on hand. You can cook with it, dry it into sachets, or just leave it where it grows to perfume the air. What do you do when it starts to fail though? **Lavender Flowers Drooping** Lavender flowers drooping is a very common problem, and it often comes down to water. Knowing how often to water lavender is usually all it takes to get it fighting fit. Lavender is a Mediterranean plant that prefers sandy, low quality soil that drains very quickly. If you've planted it in dense soil or are watering it daily, this might be the cause of your lavender flowers drooping. The key to lavender plant care is, in a way, keeping yourself from caring too much and killing it with kindness. If you've planted it in well fertilized, rich soil, move it to somewhere less forgiving, like a rocky slope that receives full sun. The lavender will thank you. If you've been watering every day, stop it. Young lavender does need considerably more water than usual to get established, but too much will eventually kill it. Always check the soil around the plant before watering-- if it's totally dry, give it a soak. If it's still wet, leave it alone. Don't water from above, as extra moisture on the leaves can spread disease. **Fixing Droopy Lavender Plants** While lavender flowers drooping might be the sign of an unhappy plant, it's not always the case. On hot days, lavender will droop to conserve water, even if it's not thirsty. It's just a natural strategy to stay hydrated. If you notice your plant drooping but don't think it's overwatered or in the wrong kind of soil, check on it later when the day is cooler. It may very well have perked up on its own. --- ## **Article 5: Indoor Lavender Varieties – Tips On Caring For Lavender As A Houseplant** Indoor Lavender Varieties – Tips On Caring For Lavender As A Houseplant If you've passed through the Mediterranean region of France, Spain, or Italy, you probably still have vivid memories of lavender fields in bloom. The fragrant purple blooms of these gorgeous, sun-loving shrubs contrast brilliantly with their delicate, gray-green leaves. Lavenders need very warm, sunny weather to thrive outdoors though. If your weather just won't do, you may wonder about growing lavender indoors. **Can You Grow Lavender Indoors?** As outside plants, most lavender likes a climate that is quite similar to the hot Mediterranean regions where they grow wild. If you live in a fog belt or don't have the room in your backyard, you might consider installing lavender as a houseplant. Not all lavender plants grow well in containers in the living room. However, some do, and if you select carefully among indoor lavender varieties, you'll soon be singing the praises of growing lavender plants inside. **Best Lavender as a Houseplant** Obviously, when you bring lavender plants inside, you are talking container plants. Since some regular lavender cultivars grow waist high, you'll do best to pick dwarf plants when you are growing lavender indoors. One cultivar to consider is 'Goodwin Creek Grey,' a fragrant variety that thrives indoors. It grows happily outside in hardiness zones 7 and above, so you can set the plants outdoors in summer if you like. 'Munstead' is another dwarf variety that does well indoors. It is compact and fragrant with rosy purple flowers. Another excellent choice is 'Little Lottie,' with its soft pink flower spikes. You can also use cultivars of French lavender (Lavandula dentata) varieties. These are smaller plants and do well in pots inside. Or try Canary Island lavender (Lavandula canariensis) or moisture-loving fern leaf lavender (Lavandula multifida). **Growing Lavender Indoors** When you are planning to use lavender as a houseplant, it's important to select an appropriate pot and good soil. Pick a pot for lavender that is only a few inches (8 cm.) larger than the plant's rootball. The plant likes tight quarters, and excess soil can easily stay too wet. Check that the pot has ample drainage holes. Use a light potting mix that drains well, adding in some sand, perlite, and compost. Mix in a little lime to tip the soil toward alkaline. Adding crushed eggshells every month or so helps keep it from turning acidic. --- ## **Article 6: Lavender Harvest Time: How And When To Pick Lavender Plants** Lavender Harvest Time: How And When To Pick Lavender Plants There are a lot of reasons to grow lavender; the amazing aroma, as a pretty border along walkways and beds, attracting bees, and to harvest and use the flowers for cosmetic or culinary purposes. Harvesting lavender plants isn't tricky, but you need to know when and how to do it in order to get the most of your bounty. **When to Pick Lavender** If you are just starting out growing lavender, keep in mind that it takes about three years for the plants to reach their peak maturity and to give you the greatest harvest. You can pick some in the first year or two, although leaving the plants alone allows them to grow and develop more. The best lavender harvest time is early in the morning if you are picking them for aromatic uses. Most of the flowers should still be closed buds. Morning is when the oils in the flowers are at their most concentrated and intense. The fragrant oils dissipate throughout the heat of the day, which is why it's important to harvest in the morning if you want the scent. If you plan to use the flowers for decoration, you can wait for them to open more. Open flowers can be used fresh in arrangements or can be dried for later use. **Harvesting Lavender Plants** When picking lavender, use sharp shears or pruners rather than breaking stems by hand. This will give you clean cuts without damaging the stems. Cut the stems low but leave a couple of sets of leaves at the base on the plant. Bundle sets of lavender stems with twine or rubber bands to keep them organized and tidy. If drying, you can hang these bundles in a spot that is warm and dry but avoid direct sunlight. Once fully dry the buds and flowers can easily be shaken or rubbed from the stems for storage."

But if other food sources are scarce, they may come along and make a meal from your plant. **Toxicity:** Lavender plants are toxic to dogs, cats, and horses. --- ## **Image 3: When to Plant Lavender? Where to Plant Lavender? How to Plant Lavender?** **When to Plant Lavender?** The ideal time depends on your climate and growing conditions. However, as a general guideline: **Spring:** The best time to plant lavender is in the spring, once the threat of frost has passed and the soil has warmed to at least 60°F (15°C). This allows the plants to establish their roots during the growing season and become better adapted to the environment before the colder months arrive. In most regions, planting from late April to May is recommended. **Fall:** In milder climates (zones 8–11) where winters are not harsh, lavender can also be planted in early fall. This gives the plant time to develop roots before winter and it will be ready to begin the dormant period. **Pots/Containers:** If you're growing lavender in pots, you can plant it in the spring or early summer and move it indoors in colder regions where temperatures drop in the fall. Keep it Fresh: 20 Best Herbs to Grow Indoors All Year. **Where to Plant Lavender?** Lavender thrives in specific conditions, so choosing the right location is key to its success. **Hardiness:** Plants perform well in USDA Zones 5–11, depending on species. Not sure about your growing zone? Check here. **Full Sun:** Lavender plants need at least 6–8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Choose a sunny spot in your garden or patio where the plant will receive ample sunlight. **Well-Drained Soil:** Prefers sandy or gravelly soil with good drainage. It does not tolerate soggy or heavy clay soils, which can lead to root rot. If your soil retains too much moisture, consider amending it with sand or planting lavender in raised beds or containers. **Good Air Circulation:** Plant in an area with good airflow to prevent humidity buildup, which can lead to fungal disease and wilting in other areas. **Neutral to Alkaline Soil:** Prefers soil with a pH of 6.5 to 7.5. If your soil is too acidic, you may need to adjust it with lime to raise the pH level. **Sloped or Elevated Areas:** Planting on a slope or in a slightly elevated area helps with drainage and prevents water-logging, especially in regions with heavy rainfall. **How to Plant Lavender?** Planting lavender requires attention to key details to ensure your plants thrive. Here is a step-by-step guide: **Prepare the Soil** - Test the Soil: Use a soil test kit to check the pH. If the soil is too acidic, add lime to raise the pH. - Improve Drainage: Mix organic matter and compost or coarse sand into the soil to improve drainage. Avoid water-retentive soils. **Dig the Hole** - Dig a hole twice as wide and just as deep as the plant's root ball. This gives the roots room to spread and establish quickly. **Plant the Lavender** - Spacing: Space your plants 12–18 inches (30–45 cm) apart for smaller varieties and up to 24–36 inches (60–90 cm) apart for larger types. This ensures good air circulation and helps prevent diseases. - Planting: Gently remove the plant from its pot, and loosen the root ball slightly. Place the plant in the hole, ensuring that the crown (where the stems meet the roots) is level with the soil surface. --- ## **Image 4: Lavender Plant Care** **Lavender Plant Care** **Watering** **Low Water Needs:** Once established, lavender is droughtolerant and prefers drier conditions. Water your plants deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Overwatering can lead to root rot and fungal diseases. **Watering New Plants:** Newly planted lavender should be watered regularly for the first few weeks until the roots are established. Once they settle in, reduce the frequency of watering. **Fertilization** **Minimal Fertilization:** Lavender does not need heavy fertilization. In fact, too much fertilizer, particularly nitrogen, can cause excessive foliage growth at the expense of flowers. A light application of compost in the spring is often enough to nourish the plant. **Pruning** **Deadheading:** Regularly removing spent flowers (deadheading) encourages the plant to produce more blooms and keeps it looking tidy. **Annual Pruning:** Pruning regularly helps maintain its shape, prevents it from becoming woody, and encourages bushier growth. Cut back about one-third of the plant's height, but be careful not to cut into the woody stems, as lavender does not regenerate well from old wood. Prune like a pro and watch your lavender burst into vibrant blooms. **Temperature and Winter Care** **Cold-Hardy:** Most varieties are hardy in USDA zones 5–9. However, in colder regions, lavender may need some winter protection. Mulch the base of the plant with straw or evergreen boughs to protect the roots from harsh temperatures. **Potted Lavender:** If you grow lavender in pots, bring the plants indoors to protect them from severe cold, especially in regions where winter temperatures fall below freezing. Keep your potted lavender thriving year-round. **How to Propagate Lavender?** Propagating lavender is an easy and cost-effective way to grow more of this beautiful, fragrant plant. There are several methods including through cuttings, layering, seeds, or division. **Cuttings** - Most reliable method. - Take 4–6 inch cuttings from non-flowering stems in spring or summer. - Use rooting hormone for faster root development. - Plant in well-draining potting mix; roots form in 3–6 weeks. **Layering** - Ideal for established plants. - Bend a long-growing stem to the ground, cover the middle with soil, and leave the tip exposed. - Roots will form along the buried section over several months; then cut and transplant. --- ## **Image 5: Growing Lavender in Pots** **Growing Lavender in Pots** Lavender is a beautiful and fragrant plant that thrives in containers, making it perfect for patios, balconies, or small garden spaces. It is relatively easy to grow in pots if you provide the right conditions. **Choosing the Right Pot** **Size:** Select a pot that is at least 12–16 inches (30–40 cm) in diameter and has good drainage. The roots need space to spread, and proper drainage is essential to prevent root rot. **Material:** Terra cotta pots are ideal as they allow the soil to dry out between waterings. Ensure the pot has several drainage holes. **Soil Requirements** **Well-Draining Soil:** Lavender thrives in sandy or gravelly, well-drained soil. Use a potting mix formulated for cacti or succulents, or mix standard potting soil with sand or perlite to improve drainage. **pH:** Lavender prefers slightly alkaline to neutral soil (pH 6.5–7.5). If your potting soil is too acidic, you can amend it with garden lime. **Planting in Pots** **Planting Depth:** Plant at the same depth it was in the nursery pot. Ensure that the crown (where the stems meet the roots) is level with the soil surface. **Spacing:** If planting more than one plant in a large container, space them at least 12 inches (30 cm) apart to allow airflow. **Sunlight Needs** **Full Sun:** Place the pot in a location that receives at least 6–8 hours of direct sunlight daily. **Rotating the Pot:** Rotate the pot occasionally to ensure even growth on all sides if it's placed in a location where sunlight may vary. **Watering Lavender in Pots** **Water Sparingly:** Lavender prefers dry conditions, so water deeply but infrequently. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings, especially for established plants. **Drainage:** Be sure to empty any saucers beneath the pot after watering to prevent the roots from sitting in water, which can cause root rot. **Fertilization** **Minimal Feeding:** Lavender doesn't need much fertilizer. A light application of balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring can help boost growth. Avoid over-fertilizing, as this can promote excessive foliage growth over flowers. **Pruning** **Shape and Growth:** Prune your plant annually to maintain its shape and encourage bushier growth. Trim back about one-third of the plant after flowering, but avoid cutting into the woody stems, as lavender does not regenerate well from old wood. **Deadheading:** Remove spent flowers (deadhead) to encourage continuous blooming and maintain a tidy appearance. **Winter Care** **Protection:** In colder climates (below USDA zone 5), bring potted lavender indoors for the winter. Place it in a cool, sunny spot, such as a south-facing window, and reduce watering during this period. **Outdoor Wintering:** In milder climates, you can leave it outdoors, but protect the pot from freezing by wrapping it with bubble wrap or burlap, and placing it on a sheltered porch or patio. **Repotting** **When to Repot:** Lavender should be repotted every 2–3 years or when the plant outgrows its pot. Choose a pot one size larger, refresh the soil, and trim the roots slightly if necessary. --- ## **Image 6: When to Harvest Lavender? How to Store Lavender?** **When to Harvest Lavender?** - Harvest once the flowers have fully opened and before they begin to wilt. - The best time to harvest is during the mid-morning after any dew has dried. - Cut the stems just above the leaves, leaving some stem length to the branches. - After cutting, tie 10 to 20 stems together into a bundle and hang them upside down in a cool, dry place away from sunlight. **How to Store Lavender?** - Once dry, the flowers can be removed from the stems and stored in airtight containers for later use. - Properly stored, they can last for up to a year. --- ## **Image 7: Aromatherapy and Relaxation, Culinary Uses, Crafting, Skincare and Beauty, Pest Control** **Aromatherapy and Relaxation** **Essential Oils:** Lavender essential oil is renowned for its calming effects.

You can also use dried sachets in closets to repel moths. **Companion Planting:** In the garden, its strong scent deters pests from nearby plants like roses, cabbages, and herbs. It's a great companion plant. --- ## **Image 8: Lavender Pest, Diseases, and Common Problems** **Lavender Pest, Diseases, and Common Problems** Lavender is generally not prone to many pest and disease problems. However, certain conditions may make it vulnerable to a few issues. Here are some common pests and diseases that may affect your plant. **Pests** **Aphids:** These insects can cause curling and distortion of the leaves and stems, as well as the production of sticky honeydew. **Spider mites:** These tiny pests can cause yellowing and stippling of the leaves, as well as the formation of webbing. **Whiteflies:** Whiteflies are small, sap-sucking insects that are often found on the undersides of leaves, where they feed on plant sap and excrete sticky honeydew. **Thrips:** These insects feed on the plant's flowers, causing them to become deformed and discolored. **Diseases** **Septoria leaf spot:** This fungal disease can cause small, dark spots on the leaves, which can eventually cause them to yellow and drop off. **Root rot:** Over-watering and poor-draining soil can lead to root rot, which can cause the plant to wilt and die. **Powdery mildew:** This fungal disease can create a powdery white coating on the leaves, causing them to turn yellow and fall off. **Common Problems** **Nutritional Deficiencies:** Lavender generally requires little fertilization, but poor soil can lead to nutrient deficiencies, manifested as weak growth or discolored leaves. A light application of a balanced fertilizer in the spring can address this. **Environmental Stress:** Extremes of cold, heat, or wind can stress lavender plants, reducing vigor or winter burn. Providing protection from the harshest elements, either through strategic planting or using covers in winter, can help. --- ## **Image 9: Frequently Asked Questions** **Frequently Asked Questions** **Does lavender come back every year?** Lavender is a perennial plant and can come back every year if it is well-cared for and planted in an appropriate location. However, the lifespan of a plant can vary depending on the specific variety and growing conditions. **Does lavender need sun or shade to grow?** Lavender needs full sun to grow and thrive. It requires at least 6–8 hours of direct sunlight each day. If your plant does not receive enough sunlight, it may become weak and spindly and may not bloom well. So, it's essential to plant it in a location with full sun. **Is Lavender Safe for Cats?** Lavender is generally considered toxic to cats when ingested due to its linalool and linalyl acetate compounds. It can cause nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. While the ingestion might not kill the cat, it is important to prevent cats from eating any part of the plant or coming into contact with concentrated essential oils. **Is Lavender a Perennial?** Yes, lavender is a perennial in many climates, meaning it can live for more than two years. Its longevity and ability to return year after year make it a popular choice for gardens. However, its perennial nature can depend on the specific variety and the growing conditions, particularly in colder climates where it may be treated as an annual. **Can You Smoke Lavender?** Lavender can be smoked and is sometimes used as a natural herb in herbal blends for its calming effects and pleasant aroma. However, smoking anything introduces smoke and potentially harmful substances into the lungs, so it's not recommended for health reasons. **Does Lavender Repel Bugs?** Lavender is known for its natural insect-repelling properties. It can deter various bugs, including moths, fleas, flies, and mosquitoes. Planting it in your garden or using its oil can help keep these pests away. **Does Lavender Spread?** Lavender can spread through its root system and by self-seeding in conducive conditions, but it's not typically aggressive or invasive. Its growth habit allows for gradual expansion, making it manageable in gardens. **How often should I water lavender?** Water young plants regularly until established. Mature lavender prefers deep, infrequent watering and tolerates drought. Avoid soggy soil."

    "content": "Lavender (Lavendula spp.) is a popular, fragrant perennial with gray-green foliage, upright flower spikes, and a compact shrub growth habit that reaches about three feet. Flowers usually bloom in summer and have a signature scent that is somewhat spicy but also calming. You should consider growing lavender because not only do these fragrant plants emit an aromatic, relaxing scent, but they will also attract tons of pollinators like bees and butterflies. They bloom for a long time and are super versatile for DIY crafts. Planting lavender is best in the spring after the risk of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up. It will grow at a moderate pace, often adding a few inches to its size each year. Note that lavender can be toxic to pets.1 2:05 Click Play to Learn How to Care for Lavender Plants Common Name Lavender Botanical Name Lavandula spp. Family Lamiaceae Plant Type Herbaceous, perennial Mature Size 2–3 ft. tall, 2–4 ft. wide Sun Exposure Full sun Soil Type Dry, well-draining Soil pH Alkaline Bloom Time Summer Flower Color Purple Hardiness Zones 5–9, USDA Native Areas Europe Toxicity Toxic to pets2 How to Plant Lavender When to Plant Be sure to plant lavender in the spring—around April or May—when the soil warms up and there is no chance of frost. Where to Plant Plant lavender in the ground in your sunniest spots. Lavender plants will tolerate many growing conditions, but they grow best in warm, well-draining soil, and full sun. How to Plant When planting lavender, dig a hole larger than its root ball, and place the plant upright in the hole. Then, backfill it with soil and some compost and water it to finish it off. If you're directly sowing the lavender seeds, plant them at a depth of 1/8th inch and scarcely cover them with soil. Space them two inches apart, however, thin the seedlings so each seed has about six inches of room. Lavender Care Plant lavender in a location that receives full sun, or at least six hours of direct sunlight, in well-draining soil. Water young plants that aren't yet established, but avoid watering mature plants. Lavender is fairly drought-tolerant. Don't fertilize lavender, which grows just fine in poor soils.

Soil Lavender plants often prefer drier soil, so it's important to use a well-draining option like a traditional potting mix that's leaning more alkaline or chalky—this will help enhance your lavender's fragrance. You can also add some sand for better drainage. Water Skip watering when it comes to mature lavender. This is a resilient plant that is extremely drought-tolerant once established. When first starting your lavender plants, keep them regularly watered during their first growing season. After that, they can handle extended periods of drought—in fact, too much water can lead to fungal disease and root rot.3 Temperature and Humidity Protect lavender from the dampness that can come with high humidity. Lavender can withstand a range of temperatures, hardy to zones 5 through 9, so it's usually dampness more than the cold that's responsible for killing lavender plants. Space Plants Out Make sure you have plenty of space between your plants for airflow, and always plant your bushes in a sunny location. Fertilizer Add a handful of compost into the hole when you are first starting lavender plants. Beyond that, feeding is not needed with these plants and can detract from the overall potency of your lavender. Types of Lavender There are many varieties of lavender, each boasting benefits and perks. Note that multiple species are referred to as \"French lavender,\" which can be confusing. Some of the most popular include: English lavender (L. angustifolia): A varietal that's available in several cultivars, including: 'Munstead,' an old-fashioned standard with blue-purple flowers; 'Hidcote,' a version favored for its dark purple flowers; 'Jean Davis,' a unique blend that produces pale pink flower spikes. Perennial in zones 5 though 9. Lavandin (Lavandula x intermedia): A varietal with several cultivars including: 'Provence,' which is particularly popular for drying; 'Grosso,' a highly disease-resistant and fragrant standard. Perennial in zones 5 through 8. Fringed or French lavender(L. dentata): A bushy, spreading shrub varietal that produces dense purple-blue flower spikes that are only mildly fragrant. Perennial in zones 5 through 9. Spanish or French lavender (L. stoechas): A small and somewhat fragile shrub. Cultivars exist with white flowers. Perennial in zones 7 through 9. Pruning Pruning lavender is recommended to keep your plant well-shaped and to encourage new growth. The best time to prune lavender is in late summer or early fall, when the plant is done blooming. Taller lavender varieties can be cut back by approximately one-third of their height, while lower-growing varieties can either be pruned back by a couple of inches or cut down to new growth. 1:40 Watch Now: How to Prune Lavender Plants Harvesting Lavender A major reason lavender is so prized is that its flowers keep their fragrance once dried. For best drying results, harvest the flowers as the buds first begin to open. Hang them in small bunches upside-down in a warm spot with good air circulation until dried. Harvesting Tip To see if your lavender is ready for harvesting, run your fingers along its stem and then bend it. If it bends effortlessly, you're all set to harvest it. Uses for Lavender There are numerous ways to use lavender once you harvest it, ranging from aesthetic to practical. Regardless of how you choose to use your lavender, be sure to store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry spot that is not prone to heat or humidity. Here are a few ways to use lavender: Floral arrangements Herbal wreaths Scented sachets Potpourris Lavender essential oil Natural pest repellant Edible uses (lavender-infused simple syrup, raw in salads, added to soups and stews, used as a seasoning, baked into cookies, brewed into tea) Companion planting in the garden, deterring deer Best Companion Plants for Lavender Companion planting is a gardening technique where plants are grown together to benefit one another, whether it be to deter pests or encourage pollination. Below, we've highlighted the best companion plants for lavender: Thyme Coneflowers Sage Rosemary Roses Oregano Propagating Lavender Lavender plants are best propagated by softwood cuttings, which you can take in spring. You can also propagate via hardwood cuttings that are available in the fall. Here's how to propagate lavender by cutting: Take a healthy cutting. Use a knife to cut a 3-inch segment of a healthy shoot. Remove the bottom leaves. Prepare a pot. Fill a small pot with a moistened seed-starting mix. Dip in rooting hormone and plant. Dip the bottom of the cutting in rooting hormone, and put that end into the prepared seed-starting mix. Cover and place in warm area. Cover the pot with plastic and place it somewhere warm with bright, indirect light. Remove covering. Once the roots are established, remove the plastic covering and place the pot back in a sunny location. Transplant outdoors. After two or three weeks, the plant can be transplanted outdoors or into a larger pot with standard potting soil. How to Rejuvenate a Woody Plant Aim to prune your lavender plants in mid-August but if you don't notice new shoots the following month, it may be a clear sign to start over. Potting and Repotting Lavender Grow lavender in a pot that's just larger than the root ball. Use well-draining potting soil, and ensure that your container has plenty of holes at its base for drainage. Plant lavender in a clay or terracotta pot to help wick moisture away from the soil and keep it from getting too wet. Repot with fresh soil when roots grow out of the drainage hole or soil level, using a vessel that is one size larger. What You'll Need Pruners are essential for encouraging lavender to continue growing and providing more blooms. A good planter with plenty of drainage holes will help you make a nice lavender container garden. A hose timer can be very helpful for ensuring you don't overwater your lavender. Overwintering Protect lavender plants from harsh winter winds by planting them next to a stone or brick wall to provide additional heat and protection. If you live in an area where the ground routinely freezes and thaws throughout the winter, your lavender plants will benefit from a layer of mulch applied after the ground initially freezes to protect the roots. Common Pests & Plant Diseases Lavender plants are not afflicted by many diseases. They may develop phytophthora, which is a soil-borne fungal disease that causes root and stem rot. Lavender can also succumb to septoria leaf spot, which is caused by a fungus and is also commonly found on tomato plants. Many common pests are attracted to lavender, including whiteflies, spider mites, leafhoppers, and spittlebugs. Water spray, insecticidal soaps, and neem oil can be helpful to eliminate pests. The four-lined plant bug (FLPB) is another pest that can be found sucking on lavender plant leaves and can be controlled by pesticides.4 Fortunately, lavender is usually deer-resistant. Pest to Watch If you suspect spider mites on your plant, look for fine white webbing, stippled and yellowed leaves, and white dots. How to Get Lavender to Bloom When planted in the proper lighting and in the proper soil, lavender should bloom each year. Bloom Months Lavender usually blooms in late spring and in the summer, from May until August. What Do Lavender Flowers Look and Smell Like? Lavender flowers are small and purple, forming in columns along the stem. Their signature fragrance is somewhat spicy but also considered to be soothing by many. How to Encourage More Blooms Make sure your lavender plants get at least 6 to 8 hours of sunlight per day. Make sure your soil isn't too fertile, as that can result in fewer blooms. Pruning the plant in spring, even if you like the size of the plant, can also result in more frequent flowering. Common Problems With Lavender Lavender plants are fairly trouble-free, but problems can occur. Here are common issues you may encounter when growing lavender indoors or outdoors. Leaves Turning Yellow Leaves turn yellow if the soil is too wet. If the lower leaves are yellow, that definitely means you are overwatering the plant. Many lavender plants will perish if their soil gets too wet over the winter months. Plant Smells Bad You have probably overwatered your lavender plant. The plant may have root rot. If you have a potted lavender plant that you think has root rot, prune the dead or affected roots with a sharp and sterilized cutting tool and repot the plant to see if it's salvageable. Drooping Leaves You have probably underwatered your lavender plant. In addition, the soil will feel parched. Leggy or Woody Growth Lavender will develop leggy or woody growth when it isn't regularly pruned. Wait until the blooming period has passed in late summer or early fall, and then prune back lavender. FAQ Does lavender come back every year? Lavender does come back every year if it is cared for correctly, as it is a perennial plant. Do lavender plants spread? While lavender plants have large root networks that do spread underground, the plants themselves prefer to grow in smaller spots. What is the symbolism of lavender? Some believe that lavender symbolizes purity, serenity, and grace. Do lavender plants repel insects? Yes, lavender essential oil is known to repel mosquitos.5 Can lavender stay out in the winter? Yes, lavender can stay out in the winter and is hardy in zones 5 and higher. If the ground freezes routiunely, you will generally need to mulch your plants to provide a layer of protection."

Technically known as Ocimum basilicum, basil can be found growing indoors and outdoors for use in a wide variety of dishes. One of the first herbs I plant in the spring, basil is easy to grow and perfect for tucking into herb, vegetable and container gardens.

Growing Basil from Seed > Planting Basil from Seed > Transplanting Basil into Your Garden > Basil Plant Care Tips > How to Harvest Basil > Varieties of Basil > Common Questions About Basil > What is Basil? Fiskars The Ultimate Guide To Growing Caring For Harvesting Basil Plants 02 Basil plants are a popular herb native to southern Asia and the islands of the South Pacific. This member of the mint family can be grown with little fuss. Considered a tender annual, the basil herb plant produces aromatic leaves that are commonly used in Italian and Mediterranean dishes. Basil seeds are also a popular Thai ingredient. Because basil is an annual, it grows extremely quickly. In fact, it can go from seed to harvest in as little as 3 to 4 weeks. This quick and easy-growing herb is an excellent choice for beginner gardeners. Growing Basil from Seed Most gardeners get a jump on the growing season and start growing basil in pots indoors from seed. You can grow basil from seeds sown indoors four to eight weeks before the last frost date. Basil is versatile and grows well in a wide variety of conditions. You can count on a decorative pot growing inside to do just as well as when you're growing basil outdoors, as long as your growing conditions are the same. Step-by-step planting basil from a seed Although the easiest way to start basil from seed is to direct sow it in your garden once the spring frost threat is over, I still like to start my basil indoors. It's a simple process that lets me get my hands in the dirt when I'm itching for spring but it's not quite yet warm enough to dig outdoors. Materials Needed: Basil seeds Starter pots Starting container with plastic dome Seed starting mix Spray mister Step 1 Prep starter pots Prepare your starter pots by adding slightly moistened seed starter mix to about ½ to 1 inch below the top of your container. I usually do this by hand, as the pots are quite small. Step 2 Add basil seeds to each pot By placing a few seeds in the center of your pot, you can select the strongest plants after germination. Some seeds are duds and won't germinate. Adding a few extras to each pot will increase your odds of success. Fiskars The Ultimate Guide To Growing Caring For Harvesting Basil Plants 03 Step 3 Cover the seeds Use a ¼ inch of dry seed starter mix. Step 4 Water Gently mist your basil seeds with water. A spray bottle with a fine spray, a specialized garden mister or even a light spray from your faucet will dampen the starter mix and give the seed good contact with the soil. Step 5 Provide humidity Keep humidity in by placing your basil in a specialized plastic starting container with a plastic dome. You could also use a shallow pan and a bit of plastic wrap for a quick and inexpensive seed starting solution. Fiskars The Ultimate Guide To Growing Caring For Harvesting Basil Plants 04 Step 6 Germination—Part 1 Place in a warm location where the temperature is approximately 70 degrees. You won't need to water the basil seeds again until after they emerge. Basil seedlings emerge in 7 to 10 days. Step 7 Germination—Part 2 Once seedings have emerged, remove the plastic dome or plastic wrap and place the pot in a sunny windowsill. Keep soil moist with frequent misting. Once true leaves appear, select the strongest seedling in each pot as your main basil seedling. You can simply pinch the other seedlings off to remove them without disturbing the roots. Fiskars The Ultimate Guide To Growing Caring For Harvesting Basil Plants 05 Step 8 Transplant Use to 3- to 4-inch pots if the plants have 3 pairs of leaves and aren't ready to go outside. You can add a weak fertilizer solution for an added boost of nutrition. Step 9 Moving outdoors Move basil seedlings outdoors gradually to harden them off. This allows the basil to adjust to the harsher outdoor conditions. Once the outdoor temps are in the 70s, move the seedlings to a sheltered location outside for a week. Fiskars The Ultimate Guide To Growing Caring For Harvesting Basil Plants 06 Transplanting Basil into Your Garden Whether you purchased basil seedlings at your local garden center or started them indoors, once the weather consistently reaches 70 degrees, it's time to move your plants into your herb, vegetable or flower gardens. Step 1 Choose a location with plenty of sunlight. Basil thrives in warm temperatures and full morning sun. If you live in an area with scorching midday sun, try to give your basil light shade during the hottest time of day. Fiskars The Ultimate Guide To Growing Caring For Harvesting Basil Plants 07 Step 2 Soil and placement Amend the garden soil with plenty of organic matter to create a rich, well-draining foundation for your basil. The bed or garden container should be at least 8 inches deep for strong root growth. Space your basil plants 12 to 16 inches apart to allow plenty of sunlight and airflow. Step 3 Dig and plant The graduated marks a Fiskars transplanter make it easy to judge the correct depth for your basil transplant. Dig a 6-inch hold, and then place the basil seedling so that the root ball is level with the soil. Use the transplanter to fill in any gaps. Then, use your hands to press the soil firmly around your transplanted basil. Step 4 Water Water your basil and apply 1 to 2 inches of mulch to help conserve moisture and prevent competition from weeds. Fiskars The Ultimate Guide To Growing Caring For Harvesting Basil Plants 08 Basil Plant Care Tips Growing basil isn't a difficult task. With just a bit of care, you may even find you have extra basil to dry, freeze or gift to friends. Some of my favorite basil care tips for a bountiful harvest include: Tip 1 Water regularly Basil likes to stay moist and requires approximately 1 inch of water every week. Water deeply at least once a week to keep roots growing deep and the soil moist. Basil growing in containers will need more frequent watering. Your goal when growing basil in a container is to keep the soil from drying out. The best time of day to water basil is early in the morning. Tip 2 Fertilize lightly Basil is a vigorous grower requiring very little to no fertilization. In fact, too much fertilization will kill the basil's flavor. If you choose to add fertilizer, a light application of a liquid fertilizer twice a season is all you really need for basil growing outdoors. If you're planning to grow basil in a pot and want to add fertilizer, your plants will require only a very weak liquid solution every 3 to 4 weeks to compensate for nutrients washed away by frequent watering. Tip 3 Pinch back leaves Pinch leaves from the tips of your basil as soon as the plant has two sets of true leaves. This encourages your basil to grow full and bushy. Tip 4 Companion planting Using this technique gives basil an excellent advantage. It may be an old gardener's tale, but many say, and I wholeheartedly believe, that planting basil with your tomatoes makes both taste better. Some of my favorite companion plants for basil include oregano, lettuce, tomatoes and peppers. Tip 5 Avoid bolting Also known as \"going to seed,\" you can avoid bolting by keeping a close eye on your plant. Basil tends to bolt once summer days are consistently hot. You can prevent this by keeping the soil moist and providing light shade in the hottest hours of the day. You can also pinch off flowering stems 1 inch below the flower to keep the plant from producing seeds and becoming bitter. How to Harvest Basil Basil isn't harvested at a specific time – you generally just grab a few leaves as you need them. However, harvesting regularly will keep your basil rounded and less leggy. It will also help keep your plant from going to seed. Harvest basil regularly. Even if you don't need it, keep harvesting consistently throughout the growing season. Aim for removing 1/3 of the leaves each month to encourage new growth. I add basil to many dishes during the summer, but I also find it freezes well in olive oil for use during the winter. Fiskars The Ultimate Guide To Growing Caring For Harvesting Basil Plants 09 Snip the stem just above the point where two large leaves meet. I keep a pair of Fiskars snips tucked in my garden apron to create clean and tidy cuts whenever I'm harvesting basil. Make sure to enjoy your harvest with a fresh recipe of your choice! Fiskars The Ultimate Guide To Growing Caring For Harvesting Basil Plants 10 Varieties of Basil There are so many varieties of basil available, it would be easy to fill your entire herb garden with just basil. Here are a few of my favorites: Sweet basil A favorite variety that is the basil sold in most grocery stores. This variety features medium-green leaves with a slightly rounded shape. Thai sweet basil Featuring smaller, pointed leaves, Thai basil grows the same as any other variety, but you end up with a bit spicier leaf that keeps its flavor well for use in stir fry. The purple flowers are beautiful and edible. Purple basil While this variety doesn't have a strong flavor, but it gives a gorgeous burgundy color to both your garden and dishes. Lemon basil and lime basil Both have a bright citrus flavor and can be used in a variety of marinades, sauces, desserts and teas. Green ruffles This variety looks nothing like traditional basil. The beautifully-ruffled leaves are mild and go well in salads. Spicy globe This small, mounding basil is the perfect variety for small spaces and containers. Although the leaves are smaller than other basil varieties, they are full of basil flavor. Common Questions About Basil How long does it take for basil to grow from seed? Basil germinates in 7 to 10 days after planting. It's usually ready for harvest within 3 to 4 weeks. Why is my basil plant wilting? There could be a few reasons why you're seeing your basil plant wilting. Start by checking the soil. Basil prefers moist soil – not too wet and not too dry. You want the soil to be damp, not drenched. Although basil loves warm weather, a hot midday sun can be rather harsh. If you see wilting only during the peak hours for summer temperatures, you may need to add light shade over your basil plant. How much sun does basil need to grow? Basil grows best with at least 6 to 8 hours of sunlight each day. Part of knowing how to care for basil is watching the sun patterns in the location you are growing this aromatic herb. With proper sunlight, your plant will be big and beautiful for several months out of the year. Fiskars The Ultimate Guide To Growing Caring For Harvesting Basil Plants 11 Is it better to plant basil indoors or outdoors? Basil is a hardy herb that grows extremely well both indoors and outdoors. As long as the plant receives the proper moisture and sunlight, it will thrive in any location. I grow basil in containers both inside and outside, and I also love to tuck it into my vegetable garden boxes. Once you know how to grow basil in a pot, the possibilities for where and how you grow it are endless. I have more basil than I can use – how do I save it? You can air dry basil by bundling it and hanging it upside down. However, the leaves will turn brown. I prefer to freeze my basil by chopping it, placing it in an ice cube tray, covering it with olive oil. Once my basil cubes are frozen, I store them in an airtight container in my freezer. When I need a bit of basil in a dish, I simply add a cube or two."

    "content": "Basil plants (Ocimum basilicum) are a popular herb belonging to the mint family. Despite their ties to Italian cuisine, they actually originate from India. Basil's aromatic leaves offer a range of flavors, from lemon-mint to cinnamon and licorice. With leaf colors varying from rich green to deep purple and textures ranging from smooth to crinkled, basil adds both taste and visual appeal to dishes. While its flowers may not be showy, they are a favorite among bees. All types of basil grow easily in warm, sunny weather. The leaves are commonly used in cooking, but the flower buds are also edible. This fast-growing herb thrives equally well in gardens and containers. With sufficiently warm weather, new basil plants are ready for pruning (to encourage bushier growth) in about six weeks. basil plant by a window Credit: The Spruce / Lacey Johnson closeup of basil leaves Common Name Basil Botanical Name Ocimum basilicum Family Mint Plant Type Perennial, annual, herb Size 18–24 in. tall and wide Sun Exposure Full Soil Type Well-drained Soil pH Acidic, neutral, alkaline Bloom Time Summer, fall Hardiness Zones 10-11 (USDA) Native Area Africa, Asia How to Plant Basil Basil, a warm-weather herb, is often planted from greenhouse nursery transplants. If growing from seeds, start them indoors about six weeks before the last spring frost. Harvesting can begin 60 to 90 days after seeding. Stop basil from blooming by pinching off the top leaves when the plant is about 6 inches tall. Once it flowers, it won't grow bushier or produce many leaves. The size of your plant will depend on the variety, the growing conditions, and how much you harvest. Basil (Ocimum basilicum) can reach 6 feet tall but typically grows to about 18 to 24 inches—or even shorter since its height is kept in check if you're harvesting regularly and not letting the plant flower. Regularly pinching basil will encourage bushy growth with more leaves. Dwarf varieties, reaching about 6 inches, are ideal for pots. Basil Care These are the main care requirements for growing a basil plant: Does best in full sun Prefers well-draining soil Likes moisture Highly sensitive to frost Light Basil thrives in six to eight hours of full sun daily. It becomes sturdier and faces fewer diseases, though it prefers part shade in very hot climates. Soil Basil thrives in moist, rich, well-draining soil. Amend soil with compost or nutrient-rich mulch. Water Water basil deeply but ensure well-drained soil. Mulch helps retain moisture. Temperature and Humidity Basil loves warmth and should be planted when days are in the 70s and nights above 50ï¿½F. Sensitive to frost, it may die in fall. Extend the season by using row covers, but keep them off leaves to prevent frost damage. If you live in a frost-free area, you might want to allow some basil plants to set flowers and self-seed in your garden. Not all varieties will do this successfully. Fertilizer Because you will be harvesting leaves from your basil plants, you may need to fertilize them often. An all-purpose fertilizer encourages continuous leaf growth. Types of Basil There are many cultivars of basil, as well as other related species with unique tastes. Try these different kinds of basil: 'Genovese' (Ocimum basilicum 'Genovese'): This variety has larger leaves than the species sweet basil, with all the flavor. 'Cinnamon' or 'Mexican Spice' (Ocimum basilicum 'Cinnamon'): Enjoy the green foliage, purple flowers, and spicy, cinnamon scent. Lemon basil (Ocimum basilicum x citriodorum): This is a hybrid plant with a distinct odor and taste of citrus. Thai basil (Ocimum basilicum var. thyrsiflora): This variety has a sweeter taste with a hint of licorice. It is very common in Asian cuisine, especially Vietnamese dishes. closeup of basil leaves Credit: The Spruce / Lacey Johnson Harvesting Basil You can start harvesting basil leaves when the plants are 6 to 8 inches tall. Even if you are not using the leaves in cooking or drying or freezing them, picking leaves regularly will improve the plant's vitality. Basil leaves can be dried or frozen for use after harvest. Dried basil is convenient but at the cost of some flavor. Frozen basil has a stronger basil flavor than dried but at the cost of texture. Use frozen basil for cooked dishes. Blend fresh basil with olive oil, freeze in trays, and store cubes in an airtight container. Propagating Basil Basil can be propagated from seeds or cuttings. Don't take cuttings from a basil plant if it's already begun to flower. Basil can be propagated at any time of year, but if there is a risk of frost, it will need to be started indoors. Here's how to propagate basil from cuttings: Take a 4- to 6-inch cutting from a basil plant below a leaf node. Remove lower leaves. Root directly in moist, well-draining soil. How to Grow Basil From Seed Basil can be grown from seed either by starting indoors or sowing directly in the garden. Here's how: If starting indoors, use seed trays and plant 6 to 8 weeks before the last frost. Keep in a sunny location, like a windowsill or under a grow light under germination. If starting in the garden, when danger of frost passes, plant seeds in a full-sun location. Water consistently, but do not overwater. Potting and Repotting Basil Basil works in almost any type of pot or container, even a kiddie pool. But there are two rules for success: keeping the soil moist and not crowding the plants. The easiest way to follow both rules is to plant in large, deep pots, which means more soil for moisture retention and more real estate for spreading out multiple plants and ensuring adequate air circulation. You can plant them as close as 6 to 8 inches apart if you desire a full look to your containers, but spacing them 12 to 18 inches apart is better for air circulation. Overcrowded plants are vulnerable to fungal problems. To make sure your container plants are properly hydrated, check the soil daily by sticking your finger into the second knuckle, and water when the soil feels dry at this depth. Use a quality potting soil that drains well so the roots do not sit in water. Also, make sure the container has drainage holes. If the soil is not premixed with fertilizer, add some organic plant food and mix it in well when filling the pot. Thereafter, feed the plants every two weeks with diluted liquid fertilizer. Common Pests & Plant Diseases Aphids are the biggest basil pest, especially with plants grown indoors. Beetles and slugs also can be a nuisance outdoors, creating holes in the leaves. Cover your entire plant with a soap solution of 2 teaspoons of dishwashing liquid to a full gallon of water to eradicate these pests. Basil is susceptible to powdery mildew, which can be controlled by providing plenty of space between plants to improve air circulation, and avoiding overhead watering, which can splash fungal spores onto the plants. Severely affected leaves should be picked off and discarded. Common Problems With Basil Yellowing Leaves There are a couple reasons your basil plant's leaves may be turning yellow. If it is getting adequate light, it could be due to overwatering. While this plant likes consistent moisture, it does not like to be overwatered. Dial back watering until the problem resolves. Brown Spots on Leaves Brown spots can result when a basil plant is subjected to cold temperatures. This plant prefers to be kept between 70-90°F, and if temperatures dip much lower than that at the end of summer/beginning of fall, the plant could start to develop browning on the leaves. FAQ Is basil easy to grow? Yes, basil is easy to grow. Even beginners can successfully cultivate this aromatic herb. How long does it take to grow basil? Basil takes about three to four weeks to be ready for harvest when grown from seed. Does basil come back every year? No, basil does not come back every year. It is an annual, which means you need to replant it every spring."

It also goes in sauces, soups and salads, plus it can be used to make herb-infused oil. Once you have a thriving basil plant, it’s sure to bring out your inner chef. bumble bee on basil flower When and How to Start Basil Basil is very cold sensitive, so it’s not a plant that you should rush outdoors. Wait until after temperatures consistently stay above 50°F to plant seeds. You can get a head start by starting seeds indoors four to six weeks before your last frost date. Using a sterile potting mix kept at a soil temperature between 70° and 85°, plant seeds a quarter-inch deep. The seeds should sprout in about a week and be kept under grow lights. Once the first true leaves appear, transplant into 4-inch pots. The seedlings can be planted outdoors once it’s warm enough, but they must be hardened off first. To harden off, slowly introduce the plants to full sun by putting them out for a half-hour on the first day, and gradually increasing the time outdoors each day for a week to 10 days, until they have spent a full eight hours in the sun. At that point, the plants will be fully acclimated and won’t become sunburned. basil seedlings Basil is a favorite plant in my summer garden and in my pesto sauce. I sow plenty each winter. These seedlings are about 10-days old. Where and How to Plant Basil Basil isn’t fussy as long as you provide it with plenty of sunlight — about 6 to 8 hours per day — and rich, well-drained soil, with an emphasis on good drainage. Basil’s minimal demands and its manageable size make this a great plant for containers. If you go that route, be sure to use an outdoor potting mix rather than garden soil which is too dense for a pot and won’t provide adequate drainage. Once you are past the mark of consistent 50°-plus days and nights, you can plant seeds or seedlings outdoors. Space plants between 1 and 2 feet apart, or one per container. Types and Varieties of Basil The most common basil grown in North America is sweet basil, and it is revered for its flavor somewhere between sweet and savory and subtly minty and pepperish. Culinary basil is most often green but there are a number of purple varieties that impart color in both the garden and on a dinner plate. Genovese basil is a cultivar of sweet basil that is traditionally used in pesto. Lettuce leaf basil grows extra-large leaves that are not quite as sweet as common sweet basil. For basil that stays short and compact, there’s bush basil, which has a more intense flavor than sweet basil. Bush basil Bush variety is a good container plant because it stays compact. It also has a more intense flavor than sweet basil. (photo: Amy Prentice) If you only grow one variety, you’ve gotta go with the classic: “Sweet Italian Large Leaf” basil. It’s THE go-to plant for so many uses in the kitchen. Still, there are so many other varieties to choose from. For a splash of color, add the variety “Red Rubin,” an All-America Selections winner offering the best of both worlds with its intense spicy flavor. Lemon basil is another popular choice and the variety “Sweet Dani” is an All America Selections winner that offers 75% more essential oils than standard lemon basil varieties. Purple basil Purple basil adds a splash of color to the garden.(photo: Amy Prentice) Watering Basil Basil does not like wet feet, so ensure it has proper drainage whether it’s grown in-ground or in a container. In the ground, basil only needs 1 inch of water a week. In a container, which typically drains and dries out faster, more water may be needed. Avoid overhead watering so the leaves remain dry. Apply water at the base of plants, under the foliage. Fertilizing Basil Basil is a light feeder, so it doesn’t require supplemental feeding. But if you do desire more vigorous growth, you can apply a liquid organic fertilizer such as fish emulsion once a week. Avoid synthetic fertilizers, which can cause nitrogen burn. Basil in raised bed Basil doesn’t need much when it’s planted in fertile soil, but feedings of liquid organic fertilizer will give plants an extra boost. Basil Pests & Diseases If you harvest basil leaves frequently, you will likely enjoy this herb before any pests or diseases can effect the older growth. Still, there are pest and disease issues to watch out for. Brown spots on basil leaves could be caused by a variety of fungal pathogens, from Cercospora to Colletotrichum. To reduce instances of fungal diseases, avoid overhead water and site basil plants in full sun, where rain and morning dew will quickly evaporate. Downy mildew can affect basil leaves and stems. Lower leaves are affected first by yellowing and then browning. The leaves will curl and wilt, and gray fuzz will appear on the underside of leaves. It’s caused by an oomycete, or fungus-like water mold. It can be soil-borne but also carried in the wind. It’s a problem in warm, humid environments. Toss out affected leaves in the garbage, and quickly use unaffected leaves before the mildew can spread further. Slugs and snails may munch on basil leaves. A bait like Sluggo, which contains iron phosphate, is a safe, organic option for slug and snail control. Flea beetles are small black or bronze jumping leaf beetles, just an eighth of an inch long. These chewing insects can be kept off basil with floating row cover. Another strategy is to plant a trap crop of radishes, which flea beetles prefer over almost anything else. Aphids show up in great numbers and suck sap from plants. Fortunately, they are easy to manage. Just spray them off the plant with a sharp stream of water. Whiteflies are similar to aphids in that they suck sap and cover plants in honeydew — and are vectors for diseases. Since you plan on eating the basil leaves, avoid treating with an insecticide, even an organic one. Like you would with aphids, spray off whiteflies with water. A variety of herbs Water and row cover are a good pest control solution for basil and other leafy herbs. Harvesting Basil Once basil is established outdoors, you can harvest anytime. Basil is ready whenever there are leaves on the plant. In fact, it’s very forgiving, and fast-growing. Just keep the tips pinched back at least weekly, especially if you notice flower heads forming. And by doing so, you’ll have a fuller plant with more branches. The best way to harvest basil is to snip as many stems as needed. Follow the stems back to the point just above a lower pair of buds or stems and make your cut there. Just don’t cut too far down, where the stem becomes woody, since the plant may not resprout new growth from there. When you cut basil properly, for every one cut, you get two new stems. That’s a great return on your investment, especially when you consider that if you were to buy snips of basil in the grocery store, a couple of those stems stuffed in a plastic clamshell will set you back at least a couple of dollars! If you don’t plan to use basil fresh, you can blanch leaves in boiling water, cool them in an ice bath, dry them completely then freeze them between layers of parchment paper. You can also oven dry fresh basil for long-term storage. Use a dehydrator, or bundle basil clippings and hang them upside down. Basil is an annual, but a cutting can be taken and grown indoors before frost kills the plant."

    "content": "As all houseplant lovers will know, the right Boston fern care is a delicate balancing act. Truth be told, these tender ferns can be a bit finicky. Popularized during the Victorian Age, the Boston fern plant (Nephrolepis exaltata) is still commonplace on Southern porches and as an indoor plant. But what works naturally in one household might fall short in another. Caring for Boston ferns is a commitment, since they require consistent moist soil, bright light and high humidity. Learning how to care for a Boston fern isn't difficult, but it is specific. Growing ferns indoors requires ongoing attention – but it is well worth your time. Here, we outline everything you need to ensure yours are happy and beautiful. Quick Boston Fern Facts: Botanical name: Nephrolepis exaltata Height: 2-3 feet (61-91cm) Spread: 2-3 feet (61-91cm) Sun exposure: Partial shade Soil requirements: Well-draining yet moisture retaining or soilless Hardiness zones: USDA 10-12 When to plant: Spring. The best care of Boston ferns relies on understanding a little of their origins, characteristics and native preferences. Also known as the sword fern, Boston fern plants are native to the tropical, moist forests of South America through Mexico, Florida and the West Indies, where this fern reaches 7ft (2m) high. An evergreen, Boston fern has sword shaped, slightly toothed fronds which arch upwards. Other cultivars have twisted, drooping, curly or wavy fronds, but the most common is ‘Bostoniensis’ with its upright spreading habit of 3ft (90cm). While most ferns are propagated by spores, the Boston fern is considered to be sterile. Instead of spores, it propagates through slender stolons that dangle from the plant. When the stolons touch the soil, a new plant forms. The genus name hails from the Greek ‘nephros’ (kidney) and ‘lepis’ (scale). Its common name is in reference to its discovery as a natural variant in a large shipment of ferns sent from Philadelphia to Boston.As mentioned, caring for a Boston fern requires commitment and consistency. These lovely ferns look gorgeous on the porches of Southern homes, but when winter strikes they die back and become less than attractive. So how do you keep them lush and green? Lighting Conditions:Ferns, including the Boston fern, are understory plants. Basically, this means that these plants thrive in partial shade. Best Watering:Boston ferns need consistently moist but not sodden soil. If you are allowing a Boston fern to go dormant, reduce the amount of water given and allow the soil to go fairly dry. Resume your regular watering schedule in the early spring. Temperature and Humidity:Boston ferns require high humidity and warm temperatures. To provide them with plenty of humidity, place near the bathroom or kitchen inside or pot them outside. To double pot, place the container with the fern inside a larger pot lined with moist sphagnum moss. To raise humidity, you can place the container-grown fern on a sauce layered with pebbles. Maintain night temperatures of 65°F (18°C). During the day, make sure the plant doesn’t exceed 95°F (358°C). Soil and Compost:Boston ferns need a well-draining yet water-retentive soil. Alternatively, you can use a soilless medium such as peat and vermiculite.  Fertilizing Needs:Boston ferns prefer rich soil or regular fertilization. For the best Boston fern care, apply a slow-release or liquid houseplant fertilizer at half strength every four-six weeks during the growing season. Stop feeding in winter. When it comes to pruning Boston ferns, you’ll find that it helps to be observant. Pruning is not necessary during the growing season, except to remove any dead fronds. Once winter arrives and colder temps, Boston ferns will likely begin to lose foliage, even when moved indoors. You can prune the plant at this time and allow it to go dormant, or wait to prune it in the spring, just before new leaves appear. Prune the plant all the way down to the crown using clean shears."

You’ll usually find it scrambling up brickwork, with its long stems and pretty pointed leaves giving it a romantic, slightly wild vibe. Fortunately, it’s just as happy to live indoors with us. Ivy thrives indoors, considering its reputation as an outdoor plant. Even better, its easy-going nature makes it perfect for new plant owners. Cool rooms, dim light – not much fazes it.The only thing ivy feels strongly about is humidity – it’s used to British weather, after all! So as long as you keep it moist and misted, it’ll be happy and healthy.Great news – ivy tolerates almost any light condition. From sunny windows to dingy corners, it isn’t really bothered about where you put it. But if you can, give it a spot with bright, indirect light (that means near a window, but not in the sun). Your ivy likes moist soil but hates being soggy. So we recommend checking the soil regularly, and watering when the top two inches feel dry. It loves humidity too, so give it a spritz with your mister every other day. Ivies also enjoy an occasional shower, to wash dirt and debris off their leaves. Nothing fancy – just a quick rinse in your bathroom should do the trick. Outdoors, ivy can scramble up brickwork incredibly quickly. It still grows energetically indoors but don’t worry, it won’t take over your living room when your back’s turned. If your ivy is getting out of control, it’s absolutely fine to snip off the longest stems. It won’t harm the plant at all. Learn more about pruning here."

    "content": "Try not to be over zealous when watering your ivy. Ivies don’t like wet soil. Wait to water until the top inch or so of the potting mix dries out. It's best to keep this houseplant a little too dry than little too wet. (This is true for most houseplants.) Also, make sure that the pot the ivy is growing is has drainage holes. So, here’s a thing that will throw you: If you overwater your ivy, the leaves will turn brown and dry on the edges. This symptom seems like the plant needs more water. The reason the leaves turn brown is that the plant roots are too wet and are basically drowning. Overly wet roots can’t deliver nutrients or, oddly, water to the plant. So, keep your ivy on the dry side.While ivies don’t like overly moist soil, they do like moist air. You can increase the humidity in your home—or at least around your plants. To do this: Add pebbles to a saucer, then add water. Set your ivy on the pebbles and the water will evaporate, raising the humidity around the plant. A too-dry plant is a stressed plant. And a stressed plant is susceptible to insect infestations or disease. Winter is especially rough on ivies. Lower light levels and dry air from furnaces and fire places stress out plants. And when plants are stressed, pests, such as spider mites. might attack. These little suckers (they literally suck the juices in plant leaves) like warm and dry conditions. If you have spider mites, you’ll know it: watch for little weblike structures on the undersides of leaves. The mites themselves are tiny and black—like little specs. They reproduce very quickly so you could have an infestation before you know it. To get rid of spider mites, spray them off the leaves with water or apply Neem oil. Ivies are native to cooler climates, originating in central and northern Europe. (English ivy is not a native plant; it was brought to the United States by colonial settlers.) So, ivies don’t like really hot temperatures indoors as some tropical plants do. They do best in cool rooms that remain between 50 to 70°F (10 to 21°C)."

That way, it will have some time to adjust to its new home without having to adjust to a new pot as well! Place your bambino near a bright window so that it gets lots of indirect sunlight, but not a lot of direct sunlight (this can scorch the leaves). If you don’t have a bright window or are unable to provide at least 8 hours of very bright light, you may want to supplement with a grow light. Water your bambino when the top 2-3 inches of soil feel dry, or better yet, when a moisture meter reads 3-4. (Here’s how to use a moisture meter for a fiddle leaf fig or bambino.) Your bambino should be ready for watering every 7-10 days. Fiddles are tropical plants, so they like humidity! If the humidity in your home is less than 40%, you may want to place your bambino on a pebble tray (just fill a shallow tray with pebbles and water to create some humidity through evaporation) or set up a humidifier nearby. Your bambino and dwarf fiddle leaf figs need the right nutrients to grow those cute little leaves and a healthy root structure!

    "content": "Plenty of bright, indirect or filtered light is KEY to a happy Fiddle Leaf Fig. Common signs of not enough light include leggy growth where the stem length between leaves gets longer, stunted or slow growth, small new leaves, or drooping leaves that don't perk up when watered. Pale or yellowing leaves (when the cause isn't water or food), can also be a sign the light level's too low. When those light levels are simply far too low, Fiddle Leaf Figs will sometimes droop or  dramatically shed the unnecessary leaves that the light level is simply too low to support, and only hold on to the bare minimum, resulting in bare stems and only a handful of leaves (I have a fix for that at the end for you). Aim to give your Fiddle Leaf Fig at least 6 to 8 'good light' hours a day. If you have a light meter, find a spot with at least 500 foot candles in a pinch (although at lower light levels a grow light is a good idea to boost light levels part of the day), but ideally aim for an average of 800 foot candles for a good 8+ hours a day for a happy Fiddle Leaf Fig. That's just the average though. Low light? Or good light but not for enough hours? Two words: grow lights. Because of their notorious hatred of being moved, in winter, instead of shifting my FLF to a brighter spot, I leave it be and use a Sansi grow light for mine (that link is for those in NZ), to supplement low light levels. If you're overseas, this Sansi 24 watt from Amazon is the same one I use in a floor lamp. You'll often see the advice to avoid direct sunlight for Fiddle Leaf Figs, however I find it's the strength of the sun that matters and they handle direct sun fine if it's not too intense. Mine get a couple of hours direct sun daily, either early morning sun or late afternoon sun and are thriving. I just wouldn't go from low light to direct sun in a great rush though. Instead let the plant have time to adjust slowly to big light changes or their leaf-dropping drama-queen tendencies can kick in. If your Fiddle Leaf Fig is getting a lean on, that's likely because it's leaning towards or away from the light. That can be a sign of too little or too much light, but to help avoid that happening, give your plant a quarter turn every fortnight or so to keep that growth even. In the wild, Ficus lyrata are actually climbers, using other trees to reach better light nearer the top of the rainforest canopy. I personally avoid repotting a Fiddle Leaf Fig unless it REALLY needs it as they can be a little dramatic during recovery. FLF's are more prone to transplant shock than most. One of the only signs I'll take as a message to repot is when I have to water far too often. Normally caused by the substrate no longer holding water for long enough, or there's no longer enough substrate left to hold water! Whatever the reason to repot, try to disturb the roots as little as possible. I've also found a seaweed or nutrient bath before you repot works wonders to help reduce transplant stress. There are lots more tips in this free repotting guide: Don't repot without doing this first > Getting the substrate right makes Fiddle Leaf Fig care a lot easier. Although your own conditions and plant parent style come into it of course, I like a half-and-half mix of a soil-based and soil-free substrates for mine. Soil-based or peat-based for the organic goodies and higher water retention, but mixed well with a chunkier, soil-free mix to bring up the free-draining, airy properties to the right balance. Coming from rainforests along the West African coast, Ficus Lyrata or Fiddle Leaf Figs prefer relatively warm conditions. One reason they do so well as indoor plants is they prefer the same temperature range we're comfortable in. Just watch those lows in winter. Aim for between 15 and 24 degrees Celsius (around 60 to 75 F). Lower than 12 degrees C (54 F), is best avoided. Lightly, evenly moist is the sweet spot you're aiming for. Over-watering is much worse than under-watering, so if in doubt, don't water. I wait until my Fiddle Leaf Fig is just over 50% dry before watering again, a little more in winter, but I find they don't like going fully dry, at least not for long.Something unique to Fiddle Leaf Figs (although I have seen it in hoyas also), is small, rust-coloured brown spots on new leaves that appear after you water, like the photo above. Often mistaken for pests or rot.The most common water-related problem with Fiddle Leaf Figs is root rot. When you do water, water heavily enough so the entire substrate is saturated top to bottom. Over-watering is when you water again too soon (it's about the frequency of watering, so how often you water, NOT how much you give when you do water). In typical household conditions, you want to let your Fiddle Leaf Fig dry to at least half way before watering again. Watering too lightly, or not often enough, can also cause root rot, also called dry root rot. That happens when the root hairs die due to being too dry too long. Then the next time you water, hello root rot, because the roots can no longer absorb the water. No matter the cause, the fungus and bacteria that cause root rot to flourish prefer low-oxygen, moist conditions. Because it spreads fast, you need to get those dead, rotting rots out of the pot asap. With their drama queen tendencies when something isn't to their liking, drooping leaves is a common concern with Fiddle Leaf Figs. There are a few common causes, so it's a matter of ruling out each one-by-one, but typically nothing to worry too much about if leaves are only drooping but not dropping off altogether! It's normal for the lower leaves of a Fiddle Leaf Fig to droop near the bottom, so if the majority are happy and perky all is probably well. Another common time they naturally droop is when they're new leaves. It takes a little while for new leaves to harden, especially when the new leaf is a big one. If it's a new leaf, hold off on worrying for a couple of days and it should firm up by itself. I find inconsistent or under-watering is the #1 cause of drooping leaves. So the first thing to check is the substrate. Does it need a drink? Next I'd consider recent changes such as repotting or moving your plant. If it's either of those I'd wait a week or two and it should settle in and the leaves should perk back up soon by themselves (it can take longer after repotting, shorter after moving). Another common cause is drooping after treatment. If you've applied anything such as pesticides or other spray-on or wipe-on treatments, give the leaves a good clean with plain water. Be extra careful after applying anything to keep leaves out of direct sun usually just for the same day of application. Sometimes the combo of certain treatments and sun can cause a chemical burn which causes leaves to droop.A quick warning on keeping those beautiful leaves dust-free. A downside of their big, leathery leaves is dust, and lots of it. They are dust magnets! A little dust isn't a biggie, but it can build up and end up blocking leaves both from getting all the light they love, as well as blocking stomata, the pores on the surface of leaves that our plants use to 'breathe' in and out or transpire. Dusty leaves can also attract pests like spider mites. So when you're faced with a dusty Fiddle Leaf Fig, what you use to clean them matters. The last thing you want is replace being blocked with dust, with being blocked with leaf shine. Most leaf shine products are silicon-based and tend to leave behind a layer that can block stomata, not to mention a gloss so shiny it looks fake. The reason a lot of planty experts will tell you to stay away from leaf shine. "

    "content": "The jade plant, Crassula ovata (or Crassula argentea) is a succulent sub-shrub native to southern Africa. It looks rather like a bonsai tree, with jade green, fleshy leaves and thick stems that become woody with age. It's a popular house plant that's also known as the money plant or friendship plant, as it's said to bring good fortune and prosperity. It's often given as a marriage or housewarming gift.The leaves of some cultivars develop a red tinge when exposed to sunlight. In time, Crassula ovata may bear small, star-shaped pink or white flowers, often in winter. It's also a good air purifier.The jade plant is the ideal house plant for beginners as it needs very little care. It will thrive if it is watered regularly in spring and summer, but it can cope with drought, as it stores water in its leaves.Grow your jade plant in a bright, sunny spot. It is best to underwater than overwater – it can store water in its leaves. Water only when the top few centimetres of compost are dry. Feed a few times a year and repot every few years, in spring.Jade plants do best in well-drained compost, so plant into a peat-free cactus or succulent compost, or a soil-based compost with some horticultural sand or grit added.Water thoroughly once the top 2-3cm of compost have become dry (stick your finger in to check). Allow any excess to drain away. Water sparingly in winter.Feed with a half-strength liquid feed once in spring, summer and autumn. Repot every two or three years in spring. If your plant has become too big to do this, scrape away as much of the compost on the surface as you can, using a fork, and replace with fresh.Using secateurs or scissors, cut away a section of stem, choosing a section that has at least two nodes (bumps on the stem – these are what leaves and roots grow from), and some leaves. Pluck away the leaves from the bottom of the cutting, leaving a few leaves at the top. Put the cutting somewhere warm and dry for a few days so the cut end can harden over. Place the cutting in water until it develops roots, then pot up into a pot filled with succulent compost or peat-free multi-purpose compost and perlite. Alternatively, plant the cutting straight into a small pot filled with multi-purpose compost and perlite, and water in well. It should develop roots within a few weeks but may look a little sickly for a while. Yellow leaves are probably due to overwatering. Reduce watering and don't let the plant sit in sodden compost – always let it drain away afterwards. Older leaves will shrivel and drop off naturally, but if lots of leaves are dropping from your plant, it's a sign that it's under some kind of stress. It may have been moved to a different spot – if this is the case, try acclimatising it gradually. It may also have been over- or underwatered. Check your watering regime and adjust accordingly.Shrivelled leaves are a sign of underwatering. Give your plant a small amount of water daily – the leaves should soon plump up again. If your plant has become leggy, it's probably not getting enough light. Move it to a brighter spot. You may spot mealybugs on the foliage. Look out for insects that look like white, fluffy blobs on the undersides of leaves. Wipe them off with a damp cloth or cotton bud that has been soaked in an insecticide that contains fatty acids or plant oils. Raised brown spots on the leaves could be scale insect. Wipe them off with a damp cloth or cotton bud that has been soaked in an insecticide that contains fatty acids or plant oils. If the leaves and stems of your plant are covered in fine webbing, this could be spider mites. The upper surface of the leaf may be mottled, while mites and eggs can be seen with a magnifying glass on the undersides of leaves. Treat with a spray containing fatty acid or plant oils."

    "content": "Jade plants, like other succulents, require soil that is very well-draining. This specimen also tends to become top-heavy, so soil with some heft to it is also imperative Choose a soil made for succulents, like this Back to the Roots Organic Succulent Mix from Amazon, or mix your own with a source of organic matter like peat moss, coir, or composted bark, plus heavier materials such as sand, grit, or rock. Bark chips or perlite can be added to improve drainage. Jade plants like an acidic soil with a pH of around 6.5. If the pH needs to be adjusted, mix in 2 tablespoons of limestone for every gallon of growing medium. You can get a 4-in-1 moisture/sunlight/temperature/PH meter, as well as garden lime to amend your soil, from Amazon. Be careful when watering. Succulents are easily overwatered, and it can be the death of them. Because succulents store water in their fleshy leaves and stems, they do not require as much irrigation as other houseplants. Keeping the soil too wet can lead to root rot. That said, too little water can result in dwarfed plants, leaf spotting and drop, and even death of the entire plant. If your jade plant is losing leaves or has leaf spots, this is most commonly caused by too little water. During their growing period from early spring to late autumn, water jades so the soil is moderately moist but not soaking wet. When the plant is out of the growing phase, reduce the amount and frequency of water given.Don’t water your jade plant on a schedule. Instead, allow the top inch (2.5 cm) or so of the soil to dry out before watering again. Do not allow a jade plant to sit in a saucer of water. For proper jade plant care, fertilize every other month to every two months with a flowering houseplant fertilizer during their growing phase from early spring to late autumn. Use a balanced water soluble fertilizer. This Miracle-Gro flowering houseplant food is a great option. Never fertilize your jade plant when the soil is dry, as this will damage the roots. Instead, water normally, then immediately water again with fertilizer. In their native region, jade plants thrive in dry, sunny areas. They need full sun in order to grow properly. If they do not have full sun, they may become stunted and leggy.Inside, jade will enjoy a full sun site in a south-facing window, but not at first. Gradually move your jade from indirect sunlight to direct sunlight to prevent scorching.Jade plant care instructions say that jade plants do best in daytime temperatures of 65 to 75 degrees F (18-24 C), and 50 to 55 degrees F (10-13 C) at night. That being said, as long as they get enough light they will do fine in temperatures that are higher than this.Because this succulent can become so top heavy, it is best to use sturdy clay or ceramic pots. Jade plants can be grown for many years when root-bound. However, it is best to repot them every 2-3 years.Repot jade plants during their growing season when new growth is evident. Prune the roots if repotting into the same size pot and cut back stems to encourage development of a thick main trunk that will hold up the top weight of the plant. Limit the amount of water given to the newly re-potted jade until it becomes established. To keep plants compact and vigorous, cut stems in the spring back to a lateral branch. This encourages trunk development and root growth. Pruning can also be done to form a bonsai at this time. Jade propagation is easily done via stem or leaf cuttings, which when pushed into the soil will root within a couple of weeks. If you do want to propagate in this manner, allow the surface of the cutting to heal over for a few days prior to planting. Propagation via cuttings can occur at any time during the year, although they root more easily during the plant's growing season. Now that you know about care for a jade plant indoors, it’s a good idea to know what kinds of problems may plague the succulent. Overwatered plants may show signs of root rot or edema, which are blisters on the leaves. White spots may also appear on the leaves of the plant. Both of these conditions are the result of the plant trying to transpire excess water from their systems, and is most likely to happen in late winter.If your jade has stems and branches that are on the verge of collapse, it likely has a bacterial rot that can not be treated and unfortunately the plant should be thrown away. If powdery mildew is evident along with scabby or corked areas, treat with a horticultural oil or copper fungicide, like this option from Amazon.With the exception of watching how much water your plant gets, jade is an easy to care for specimen. However there is one jade pest to look out for: mealybugs. The nymphs of this insect are the actual problem as they pierce soft plant tissue and feed on the sap. They also leave behind sooty mold. Mealybug nymphs can be treated with an alcohol swab rubbed along the surface of the foliate."

    "content": "An important part of caring for your jade plant is to make sure that it gets enough water, but not too much water. A quick water tip is to stick your finger in the soil and if the soil is dry to your knuckle...give her a good water shower. Make sure you allow the soil to dry before watering again as these plants will die from overwatering. If you see leaves suddenly drop or you notice distorted growth, you have probably overwatered. If you are a forgetful plant parent, this is the perfect house plant for you. Jade plants are succulents, but they aren't too fussy about the amount of light it gets. It does grow best with bright indirect light. If your jade plant is not getting enough sun they will let you know. They will start to stretch their little plant bodies looking for any morsel of sunlight they can find. They will become stunted and leggy or in technical terms, etiolated, for all my plant nerds out there. Propagating a jade plant is probably the easiest, and I mean the easiest, thing you can learn how to do. My girl, Jade, is actually what got me hooked on making more plants from the plants that I already had. I mean who doesn't like free plants. My grandma would just pinch the mother plant with her fingers and throw the cutting into the backyard. I went down to see the area where she was throwing the cuttings and there was a whole sea of jade thriving. Leaf propagation can be done by gently twisting a healthy leaf off of the mother plant. Then simply place the leaf on top of the dirt and in a couple of weeks, you will start to see roots growing and then eventually a little jade plant. My favorite way of propagating jade plant is by trimming or pinching a cutting off of the mother plant. You can do this by simply finding a part of your plant that looks suitable to trim. If the plant is small and has not branched off - trim the top! Then place the cutting in the soil and watch a new plant start to grow! Click here for a quick video on how I do this.If your plant has already branched you can trim where you see the brown rings. Simply trim along those rings where you want. Place the cutting on or in the soil and I promise you, roots will grow!. I like to put the cuttings in a separate pot or recycled plastic container and wait for them to root before planting in them in their new home! I have propagated plenty of gifts for my friends this way and they seem to love it (hopefully lol). Light: Can survive in medium light situations, but thrive in bright indirect and direct light. They can survive outside during the summer, but need to be acclimated gradually to the change in light intensity. Temperature: This bad biddy is highly tolerant of most temperatures and humidity. They can even survive in light frost but will die in freezing conditions.Watering: Like most succulents, it's best to allow the soil to completely dry out...like bone dry before watering again. Water more liberally during active months (Spring and Summer) and less during the winter months! Fertilizer: Jade can be fertilized every two months during the active months.  "

Close-up detail of a croton plant on a white studio background Croton plants are beautiful, bright, and vibrant plants that are a great addition to any home. They're easy to care for and require very little maintenance. Here's a some advice on how to care for your croton plant: Give your croton lots of bright, indirect light. The more light it gets, the more colourful its leaves will be Water when the top inch of soil feels dry, it likes its soil to be moist Keep your croton warm, it may drop leaves if it's feeling chilly About crotons Native to India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and the western Pacific islands, the croton enjoys hot, humid climates. If yours is feeling the cold you’ll notice some leaf drop, so keep it in a warm, bright room and away from cool draughts. They're not the easiest plants to look after, but with the right care and attention a croton makes the perfect - and unusual - centrepiece for your collection. Our croton 'Iceton', Chrissy, is particularly fabulous. Croton 'iceton' plant in a green fractured pot on a side table in a living room How much light does my croton need? Crotons prefer bright, indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight, as this can cause the leaves to burn. Put yours away from the window in a room that has lots of natural light. How often should I water my croton? Crotons need to be watered regularly but not too much. They like their soil to be kept moist at all times, so water her with lukewarm water when the top inch of soil starts to feel dry. What's the best temperature for my croton? Crotons prefer temperatures between 18°C and 29°C. Avoid cold drafts and extreme temperatures. You'll know your croton is feeling the cold because it will start to drop leaves - fast! Does my croton need a humid environment? Crotons prefer high humidity. You can increase the humidity by misting the leaves or placing a humidifier near the plant. A great spot for your croton would be in a naturally humid room, like a bright kitchen or bathroom that gets lots of natural light. Should I fertilise my croton? Feed your croton plant with a balanced fertiliser every two weeks during the spring and summer - the growing season. This will help it pop out more bright and beautiful leaves. Do I need to prune my croton? You can prune your croton plant to maintain its shape and encourage new growth. If you spot any leaves that are dead or dying - think crispy, soggy or very discoloured - just chop them off. This will help your croton put its energy into growing new leaves. When should I repot my pothos? Repot your croton plant every two years or when the roots start to become crowded. You'll notice roots pushing their way out of the nursery pot at the top and through the drainage holes in the bottom. Try to repot in spring or summer when the plant is in its growing season. Common croton pests Watch out for common pests such as spider mites, mealybugs, and aphids. Clean your croton's leaves regularly with a damp cloth - this will help remove existing pests and dust, and is a good opportunity to look out for new visitors. Following these simple steps will help your croton plant stay healthy and happy. With the right care, your croton plant can be a vibrant and beautiful addition to your home."

    "content": "Croton, Codiaeum variegatum Croton, Codiaeum variegatum, is grown as an ornamental for its striking foliage. Croton, Codiaeum variegatum, is a common houseplant grown for its striking foliage. It is one of six species of broadleaf evergreen perennials, shrubs, and small trees in this genus in the euphorbia family (Euphorbiaceae) which are native to tropical Asia and the western Pacific region (not to be confused with Croton, another genus of more than 700 species in the same family, in which it was formerly incorrectly classified as Croton variegatum). This evergreen shrub or small tree varies widely in leaf color and pattern and numerous cultivars have been developed. It is a tender perennial, hardy only in zones 11-12. In subtropical and tropical climates they are frequently used as landscape shrubs for dramatic hedges, bold focal points in gardens, or potted specimens around buildings. Croton is a small shrub used as a landscape plant in tropical climates. In its native habitat, croton is a branching, bushy shrub that grows up to 10 feet tall but those offered as houseplants are usually much smaller than the wild plant. The large, thick, leathery leaves are 2 to 12 inches long and quite variable. The shiny, alternate leaves may be linear to oval, have a smooth or lobed margin (sometimes deeply cut to the midrib), and some are wavy or twisted into a spiral. The foliage color ranges from green variegated with white, pink, orange, red, yellow, or purple in various combinations that may change as the leaves age. Markings may follow along the major veins or may be blotches on any part of the leaf blade in regular or random patterns. Sports, or shoots that are completely different in appearance from the parent plant, are not uncommon. As with most plants in the Euphorbiaceae, the milky sap that bleeds from cut stems may cause contact dermatitis in susceptible individuals. The leaves of Codiaeum variegatum vary in color even on the same plant (L) and in shape from oval to linear, with entire or lobed margins (RC) and can be twisted or wavy (R). When grown as a houseplant it rarely flowers. When growing in the ground in frost-free climates in spring it produces insignificant flowers in long axillary racemes. The white male flowers with five small petals and 20-30 stamens that give a starburst-like effect are produced on separate inflorescences than the yellowish, petal-less female flowers. The male flowers are produced on long inflorescences (L-RC) with many stamens (R) that give a starburst effect. Pollinated female flowers are followed by fruits which are a small tripartite capsule about a third of an inch in diameter containing three small seeds. The female flowers are produced on stouter inflorescences (L), each with three stigmas and no petals (LC and C). Fertilized flowers are followed by rounded fruits (RC and R). Croton is usually offered as a houseplant, but can also be used as a seasonal accent plant outdoors. Croton is typically offered as an indoor plant but can also be used outdoors as a seasonal accent plant in containers or plantings of annuals or mixed ornamentals. If growing in containers, indoors or out, think about choosing a pot color that accents the color of the foliage, either echoing one of the leaf colors or something that contrasts with the dominant color. Try combining croton with other tropical plants grown as annuals that have flowers in colors that repeat the color(s) of the leaves, such as orange-flowering lantana, yellow golden shrimp plant, or red pentas. Or choose something with purple flowers, such as angelonia or mealycup sage, to contrast with a croton cultivar with orange and red foliage. Croton has the best color in bright, indirect light. Croton does best in fertile, well-drained, moist soil. They need bright, indirect light when grown indoors. Outdoors they thrive in partial shade, and in cool climates can tolerate full sun if kept moist (and are acclimated first when moved from inside). Higher light produces more vibrant color in the leaves and a more compact plant. The colorful leaves may revert to shades of green in insufficient light, while too much direct sun makes the leaves gray and dull looking. These plants have moderate water needs and should be watered only when the top half-inch to an inch of soil dries out. Reduce watering in the winter. Plants will drop leaves if they are too wet or too dry for extended periods. As a tropical plant, it does best with moderate to high humidity and warm temperatures. Several varieties of croton in a landscape in Hawaii. Croton does best at temperatures between 60 and 85ºF, often suffering leaf drop if temperatures remain below 50ºF. Protect them from drafts and severe fluctuations in temperature. Changing environments too quickly can shock the plants and cause leaf drop. Fertilize once or twice during the growing season or more frequently if you want faster growth. Repot when the plant outgrows the container, moving up to a pot only 1-2 inches larger. Plants can be pruned hard in early spring before new growth begins to stimulate branching and new growth if they get leggy. Croton has few pest problems other than the usual insects that commonly infest houseplants (mealybugs, spider mites, scales). Croton is easily grown as a container plant. Container-grown plants can be moved outdoors for the growing season once temperatures are consistently above 50ºF, gradually acclimating them to the different light levels outside and moving them back inside in the fall before temperatures drop below 50ºF (colder temperatures can cause leaf loss). Plants used as seasonal plants planted in the ground can be lifted and potted in the fall. This plant is easily propagated by air layering in spring or by taking softwood cuttings in summer. Although it can be grown from seed, the offspring won’t resemble the parent, so asexual propagation is the only way to maintain specific cultivars. ‘Gold Dust’ croton. There are several hundred cultivars of this popular foliage plant, selected and bred to offer a wide diversity of leaf shapes and colors, plant sizes and improved tolerance of low light interior conditions (although the names are often not indicated when offered for sale), including: ‘Andreanum’ has broadly oval yellow leaves with gold veins and margins. ‘Eleanor Roosevelt’ has long, slender leaves of medium green dotted with golden yellow spots, changing with age to dark red. ‘Franklin Roosevelt’ is similar, but splashed yellow, orange and pink. ‘Gold Star’ croton. ‘Evening Embers’ has unusual metallic blue-black leaves highlighted in red and green. ‘Gold Dust’ has bright green rounded oval leaves spotted with golden-yellow. ‘Gold Star’ is similar to ‘Gold Dust’ with yellow spots splashed across the bright green leaves, but with much narrower leaves. ‘Magnificent’ has green and yellow variegated oval-pointed leaves spattered in brilliant shades of red, orange, pink and sometimes bronze or purple. ‘Majesticum’ has pendulous branches and linear leaves with yellow midrib veins that mature from deep green to red. ‘Mammy’ croton. ‘Mammy’ (or ‘Mammie’) has elongate, twisted, multi-colored leaves tending towards greens and purples with bits of red. ‘Oakleaf’ has multicolored leaves with indentations resembling those of an oak leaf in greens to bronzes with red, orange, or yellow veining. ‘Petra’ is one of the most common croton varieties available with variously colored bold yellow, pink and orange to red markings along the veins of the dark green pointed-oval leaves that creates an almost lacy appearance when viewed from a distance. ‘Petra’ croton. ‘Mrs. Iceton’ or ‘Red Iceton’ has pointed-tipped oval leaves that start out a bright, warm yellow and change into pink and red as they age. ‘Spirale’ has narrow red and green leaves that twist in a spiral. ‘Thai String’ has multicolored, very narrow leaves. ‘Zanzibar’ has long, slender, grassy-looking leaves in shades of purple, red, orange, and gold. Other croton cultivars (L-R): unknown, ‘Irene Kingsley’, unknown, ‘Iceton’, ‘Thai String’ and ‘Ramshot’. – Susan Mahr, University of Wiscon"

No, it is not a garden staple on the planet Mars. Despite the fact that its name sounds like it came from a space movie, the croton plant, or Codiaeum variegatum, is a perennial evergreen shrub, native to India and Malaysia. The name “croton” comes from a Greek word for tick, as the croton seed resembles a tick in shape. This tropical plant has thick, leathery leaves of varying colors, shapes, and sizes. As it ages, the plant’s color may darken to nearly black. How do you pronounce \"croton?\" “Croton” is pronounced “crow-tun” or spelled phonetically, [kroht-n]. Are the croton plant and the rushfoil the same thing? Rushfoil is a common name for a particular species of croton plant, the Croton michauxii, or Michaux’s croton. The word “croton” is often used generically to refer to all different species within the genus. Are there different Croton plant varieties? There are many different croton plant varieties. This plant grows in an assortment of shapes and colors including red, orange, purple, pink, yellow, green, and white. Here’s a list of some of our favorite types: Banana Croton Bush on Fire Croton Eleanor Roosevelt Croton Gold Dust or Gold Sun Croton Magnificent Croton Mammy Croton Mrs. Iceton Croton Oakleaf Croton Petra Croton Sunny Star Croton Yellow Iceton Croton Zanzibar Croton Is the croton plant poisonous? Though it is not the most poisonous of plant varieties, you should not take a chance and ingest the croton plant. If consumed in large quantities, it can cause abdominal discomfort, vomiting, diarrhea, and other like symptoms. Additionally, the croton plant puts off a sap that can both stain and cause skin irritation. Can I have croton plants with cats? The croton plant can have a similar effect on cats that it does on humans. When ingested, croton sap may make your cat sick, and because its leaves are big and full of beautiful color, they can be very alluring to cats. If you do have both a croton plant and a cat, display your plant in an area that your cat cannot easily access. If your cat, or other pet, is lethargic and vomiting and you suspect that they may have ingested croton plant, take him/her to the veterinarian. Can I keep my croton plant indoors? Croton plants can be planted in containers and kept indoors, but they should be put in a location that receives significant exposure the sunlight. Without light, the croton’s colors will fade. A humidifier may be helpful for an indoor croton in the case of a dry interior climate. When kept inside, it is easy for the plant to become dusty. If this happens, you can take the plant outdoors to spray it off or use a wet sponge to remove any dust and pest residue. croton leaf What are the benefits of croton plants? At one time, the oil from one species of croton, Croton tiglium, was used medicinally as a purgative. These days, croton plants are used primarily for their aesthetic value. Adding a croton plant brings a burst of color to an otherwise green landscape. Why are croton plants popular? Croton plants are popular because of their stunning colors. Many assume that to add color outside of green to a garden, one must add flowers. But that’s not true. Croton plants offer a colorful, non-flower option that can be planted outdoors (if the conditions are right) or indoors to brighten up a room. How tall does a croton plant get? Croton plants can grow up to ten feet high, but dwarf varieties exist that are much shorter. Customarily, the croton plant does not exceed three feet in height. The plant is usually very full, however, as the large leaves cluster together to create volume. Do croton plants flower? Mature croton plants can produce small, fairly insignificant flowers. The so-called flowers will appear as small bulbs (similar to the size and shape of a holly berry) and may have extensions that shoot out like a tiny firework. Croton Plant Care What temperatures do croton plants tolerate? Having originated in a tropical climate, croton plants prefer warm conditions. If temperatures drop too far below 55℉, the plant’s leaves may begin to turn brown. Ideally, the croton plant will do best at temperatures of 80℉ or below, as the plant will not thrive in extreme heat. The other tip would be to watch how often you water the plants. Remember that succulents by their very nature do not need much water. If you have them indoors and have your succulents in saucers, toss away the excess water that gathers there after you water them. If you chose a variety of air plant, just mist the plants. Beyond that, make sure that you read the information that comes with the plants and ask questions of the plant or garden experts to make sure you know how to care for any and all plants you want to put into your garden. How often should croton plants be watered? Again, the croton plant originated in a tropical environment, so it favors a warm, humid environment. The soil in which the croton is planted should remain moist but not constantly wet during spring and summer when the plant is growing. Feel the soil and if it is dry to the touch, it may be time for watering. In a dry environment, the croton may require misting to maintain healthy leaf growth. Much like with other plants, watering croton plants can be a delicate science. The croton plant requires frequent watering, but be sure not to over-water. Too much water can cause root rot, but too little water can dry the humidity-loving plant out. You can use new croton foliage as an indicator of water needs, as it will begin to wilt when thirsty. How much light do croton plants need? Croton plants prefer full sun, but depending on the species, some can tolerate partial shade. The amount of sun that the plant receives will correlate to the intensity of its color. In order to attain full, vibrant color, the plant should remain in good light. Are croton plants perennial? Yes, croton plants are perennials. The word ‘perennial’ itself means “through the years.” A perennial plant like the croton will live through many growing seasons. Even if part of the plant dies (usually during the winter), it will use the same root system to regrow in the spring. What kind of soil is best for croton plants? Croton plants grow best in soil that allows for adequate draining while still maintaining enough moisture to foster growth. If the growing medium retains too much water, the plant may become subject to root rot. croton My croton plant appears to be dying. Can I revive it? Depending on the source of the stress on your plant, there are various things you can do to revive a croton plant. If your plant is not in a well-lit area, try moving it to a spot that gets at least 4-5 hours of sunlight each day. Additionally, ensure that your croton plant is not placed in the path of an especially hot or cold airstream. If neither of these is the reason your croton plant is not thriving, make sure that the plant does not have too much or too little water in its soil. Either one can cause problems in the croton plant. You may also want to take special care to wipe or spray the leaves to get rid of any pests that may be lingering around your plant. Why is my croton plant losing its leaves? Croton plants can lose leaves for a number of reasons. Ordinarily, this plant will lose its leaves due to some sort of stress. This stress could come from moving the plant from outdoors to indoors, or vice versa, or an imbalance in essential nutrients. If the plant is just adjusting to a new environment, give it time. After a couple of weeks, it will settle in and begin to grow once again. If you haven’t moved your plant recently, leaf loss could be due to exposure to extreme temperatures, insufficient light, improper watering, or disease/pests. How do you prune a croton plant? Croton plants should only be pruned to remove unhealthy portions of the plant or to maintain a certain shape.Dead leaves or branches should be cut back to their origin, but overgrown leaves or branches can be trimmed just above a node or leaf set. Make sure not to remove more than ⅓ of the stem height at one time. Before pruning again, allow more growth. What should I do with my croton plant in the winter? Crotons thrive in warm weather, but they do not tolerate hard frosts well. If you live in the southern United States, where it does not often reach low temperatures, outdoor croton plants can be covered to protect from frost. In colder locations, it is best to grow croton plants in containers so that they can be transported indoors when outdoor temperatures become too extreme. They can recover from an intense frost, but you shouldn’t make them endure repeated frosts. If you do take your croton plant indoors, place it in a location that gets a substantial amount of light. These plants also prefer humid environments, so you may want to consider using a humidifier or misting them yourself. How do you propagate a croton plant? Propagating a croton plant is best done with a 3-4 inch stem cutting. The cutting should have 3-5 leaves on it and can be planted in a small pot to start. Keep the plant in a warm environment (ideally 70-80℉) and maintain moisture in the soil. In these conditions, the plant will likely take root within a month and then you can transplant it elsewhere. As the croton plant matures, it will develop color. What are the common croton plant diseases? Generally, croton plants do not have many issues with pests or diseases. However, they can sometimes fall victim to common plant pests such as mealybugs, scale, thrips or spider mites. You can remove these pests from your croton plant with a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol. Keep a close eye on the leaves of the croton so that you are able to catch any potential pest infestation early, before it has the opportunity to do major damage to your plant.

    "content": "How to Grow and Care for Areca Palm This easy-care clumping palm can be grown outdoors or as a houseplant Areca palms (Dypsis lutescens) are tall, clumping palms with smooth trunks that are reminiscent of bamboo clumps. Their fronds are narrow, almost like bamboo leaves. These low-maintenance, air-purifying palms grow about half a foot per year indoors, ultimately reaching about 8 feet. In the summer, small, bright yellow but inconspicuous flowers grow from below the fronds. Although endangered species in its native Madagascar, the palm is a common sight in outdoor plantings in the United States where it grows in warm climates, often lining streets or used as a privacy screen. an areca palm indoors Credit: The Spruce / Alonda Baird Common Names Areca palm, bamboo palm, golden cane palm, yellow palm Botanical Name Dypsis lutescens (formerly Chrysalidocarpus lutescens) Family Arecaceae Plant Type Perennial Mature Size 6-7 ft. tall, 3-4 ft. wide (indoors), 15-30 ft. tall, 8-10 ft. wide (outdoors) Sun Exposure Full, partial Soil Type Moist but well-drained Soil pH Acidic, neutral Bloom Time Summer Flower Color Yellow Hardiness Zones 10–11 (USDA) Native Area Africa Areca Palm Care Here are the main care requirements for growing an Areca palm: Choose a location with bright, full, or filtered sunlight. Water whenever the soil starts to dry out. Maintain warm temperatures if possible, as these plants appreciate 70°F or higher. Plant it in well-draining, slightly acidic soil or special palm potting mix. Fertilize regularly during the spring and summer. Dusting Tip Areca palms fronds can get quite dusty, but with so many narrow leaves it's tricky to dust. Pop the entire plant in the shower and spray it down with a detachable shower nozzle. Let it drip dry then return it to its spot. closeup of an areca palm Credit: The Spruce / Alonda Baird closeup of an areca palm leaf Light Outdoors, Areca palms like bright, filtered sunlight but they also tolerate full sun. Indoors, Areca palms do best with bright light exposure from a south- or west-facing window. Soil For potted indoor plants, choose a well-draining, peat-based potting mix, ideally a potting mix specially formulated for palms. However, if you're planting your Areca palms outdoors, they do the best in rich, slightly acidic soil with very good drainage. Water Areca palms prefer moist but well-draining soil. They don't like their soil to dry out completely in between waterings. Check weekly with a moisture meter to see if the soil is approaching dry and water as needed. Temperature and Humidity Indoors or outdoors, Areca palm best in average temperatures of 70°F to 80°F. It can survive if the temperature briefly goes below freezing, but for best results it should only be planted where outdoor temperatures are always above 50°F.1 Area palm prefers high humidity; if the air is too dry, it's common for leaf tips to turn brown. Fertilizer The Areca palm is a heavy feeder that requires fertilizing from spring to early fall. For outdoor plants, use a slow-release fertilizer high in nitrogen and potassium or a special palm food. Follow the label instructions for amounts and frequency. Do not feed during fall and winter. Indoor Areca Care Where to Put It:Make sure to place your Areca palms in an area where they will receive bright, filtered sunlight from a south- or west-facing window. When to Water It:These plants need consistently moist soil, but make sure you don't overwater them. Only water the plant when the topsoil is dry and decrease watering in the wintertime. Best Soil Type:Areca palms need well-draining and slightly acidic to neutral soil. Consider a high-quality mix consisting of perlite, coarse sand, and peat moss. Pruning These palms don't need much pruning or trimming. The Areca palm is self-cleaning, which means it typically will shed its brown fronds on its own. Wait to remove any dying fronds until they are mostly brown, as they still play a role in photosynthesis. Pruning Tip Looking for the best pruners for your areca palms? We tested 8 top-rated pruners in our Lab to make sure your plants stay happy and healthy. Propagating Areca Palm The best way to propagate Areca palm is through root division. Don't both trying to grow an Areca palm from seed—it's a lengthy process and involves steps not recommended for home gardeners. Root division can be done at any time during the year, but the plant will be at its strongest in the spring. Here’s how to divide a potted Areca palm by root division: Find the right plant. Choose a mature plant with multiple stems. Loosen the roots. Water well the day before dividing to loosen up the roots from the soil. Remove the plant. Pat the sides of the container to loosen the rootball, then remove the plant from the pot. Shake soil from the roots. Rinse soil from roots to see the roots that belong to each stem. Make the cuttings. Cut four to five stems off the parent plant with a sharp knife. Divide the stems. Gently place divided stems together in a pot with a 2-1 mixture of regular potting soil and coarse sand. Place plant in the right location. Place the pot in bright and indirect light (not direct sun) and keep the soil moist but not soggy. Potting and Repotting Areca Palms Areca palms like a somewhat cramped container with ample drainage holes, and crowded roots will aid in keeping the palm's size in check for growing as a houseplant. Repot every two years or so to refresh the potting soil and remove built-up fertilizer salt deposits. Use the same pot if the palm's root ball still comfortably fits. Otherwise, move up one container size. Common Pests & Plant Diseases Areca palms don’t have serious issues with pests or diseases. Occasionally a palm may be infected with lethal yellowing, an insect-transmitted bacterial disease that causes fronds and ultimately the whole palm to die.2 Outdoor palms are more likely to become afflicted with this, and because treatment usually isn’t effective, it’s typically best to remove the palm before the disease spreads. Indoor Areca palms are vulnerable to common houseplant pests, including mites, aphids, mealybugs, scale, and whiteflies, which cause foliage damage and discoloration. Treat any infestation as soon as possible.2 Pest to Watch A good indication that your plant may have aphids is if you notice ants on your plant. Ants appear to feast on the honeydew secretions left behind by aphids. Common Problems With Areca Palm Although the plant is easy to care for, it is prone to leaf tip burn, which occurs on both indoor and outdoor Areca palms: Tips and leaves turning yellow or brown can be caused by chilly air, overwatering, underwatering, poor soil conditions, or compacted roots.2 Is This the Right Plant for You? You want a low-maintenance houseplant that has air-purifying qualities. You have enough space for a plant that can grow up to 8 feet tall. You want a pet-friendly houseplant that isn't toxic. FAQ Are Areca palms hard to grow? No, these palms are not too challenging. Place it near a south-facing window and keep the soil just slightly moist. Can I put my Areca palm outside for the summer? Yes, these palms will thrive outdoors, as long as the temperature does not creep below 50°F. Wait until night temperatures have hit this benchmark before moving your plant outside, and don't forget to move it back indoors in the fall. Should I water my Areca palm from the top or bottom? Both methods will work for this palm. What's more important is that the soil not get too soggy. Use a moisture meter to confirm whether the soil needs to be watered or not. How long do Areca palms live? The lifespan of an Areca palm is 10 years, provided the plant receives proper care and maintenance.3 Do Areca palms like sun or shade? Areca palms thrive in sunlight. If you're growing your palm outdoors, place it where it will receive bright, filtered sunlight. If you're growing your plant indoors, they do best with bright light exposure from a south- or west-facing window."

What is more, caring for a butterfly palm is remarkably easy, and it even grows well in water – here is how! Areca palm plant indoors The areca palm is a popular houseplant from Madascar [Photo: Pixel-Shot/ Shutterstock.com] The butterfly palm, also known as areca palm (Dypsis Lutescens), is a popular house and office plant. And no surprise! This feather-leaved palm is an effective air-purifier that grows well in both soil and water. Read on for tips on areca palm care and how to avoid common mistakes. Contents Areca palm: flowers, origin and characteristics The areca palm belongs to the palm family (Arecacea) and originates from the tropics of Madagascar, where it can reach a height of up to ten meters. Known as the ‘yellow palm’ and ‘golden cane palm’, this evergreen produces light yellow flowers and golden yellow fruit. As a houseplant, however, the areca palm will not grow taller than three meters and almost never comes into bloom. Nevertheless, its evergreen, feather-like leaves and upward stretching, fountain shape is very attractive. It is also known to effectively purify the air and produce plenty of oxygen, which is why it is especially popular in offices. Tall areca palm trees in Madagascar In its native country, the areca palm grows much taller than in our homes. [Photo: Onkar gawade/ Shutterstock.com] Top tips for planting an areca palm The butterfly palm prefers bright, warm conditions with moist to wet soil. In spring, plant your palm in a pot with some all-purpose soil. Our Plantura Organic All Purpose Compost is a great choice. It supplies plenty of nutrients and is slightly acidic – perfect for the Areca palm. So that the soil can drain properly, mix in at least 30% sand or pumice. Furthermore, it is important that excess water can drain out of the pot, as your butterfly palm will not tolerate water stagnation. The pot should be as deep as possible, because the areca palm forms a taproot, which requires a lot of room to spread downwards.

Place your evergreen in a bright spot. It should be out of direct sunlight, warm and humid. In winter, butterfly palms tolerate lower temperatures, but make sure it is between 15 and 24°C. Areca palms grow well hydroponically. This means they do not require any soil, only water or a nutrient solution. There are many benefits to hydroponic plants, not least: your plants will enjoy the humid conditions and you can water them in advance! To grow your palm hydroponically, fill a container with expanded clay or some other growing medium (this will support the plant and provide enough air for the roots), before pouring in the water. It is a good idea to use a water-level meter and hydroponic fertiliser. Areca palm in bright room The areca palm should be kept a bright place free from drafts [Photo: Aquarius Studio/ Shutterstock.com] Areca palm care: the key steps Areca palms are undemanding, but they do need regular attention. Because it is a tropical plant, that has evolved to expect wet and dry seasons, high humidity and warm temperatures, the golden cane palm requires specific care in summer and winter. Watering Dypsis lutescens It is important that your areca palm never dries out and is never left in standing water. This might take a bit of practice. It will depend on your plant’s size and the volume of the container. In general, it is best to water little and often. The soil should remain moist, so as soon as the upper layer of soil is dry, water it again. Use slightly acidic, low-fluoride water like rainwater, distilled water or mineral water without fluoride. In winter, areca palms stop growing and will require less water. But never let the root ball dry out completely! Tip: Since the butterfly palm needs humid conditions, it is a good idea to regularly spray it with water. In winter, you could also place a bowl of water on the radiator. Golden cane palm fruits Its golden fruits have given the golden cane palm its name [Photo: Explore Reloaded stock/ Shutterstock.com] Fertilising areca palm The areca palm requires a lot of nutrients to grow, so it’s important to use fertiliser. Since golden cane palms are sensitive to chloride and fluoride overdoses, however, avoid mineral fertilisers, as they are made of salts. Our Plantura Liquid Houseplant Food will provide your yellow palm with rich nutrients from plant-based, raw materials. What is more, the fertiliser works well with other green plants.

Pruning areca palm Areca palms need not be pruned. However, do remove yellow, dead or dried leaves. These often appear at the edge, as the plant always forms new leaves in the centre. To remove these leaves, cut them at the base, close to the main stem. If your butterfly palm is too big, cut off some of the outer leaves at the base. Areca palm leaves turned yellow If the areca palm leaves turn yellow, this may be for a number of reasons [Photo: Alohapatty/ Shutterstock.com] Transplanting areca palm Older areca palms require new soil every few years, though it is worth replacing the top layer now and then. If the roots of your plant are filling the pot, it is time to transplant your palm. This is best done in spring, just as the plant starts growing. Use a deep pot, with enough room for the roots to spread, and use two-thirds fresh, all-purpose soil with one-third sand or lava granules. The fresh soil provides nutrients, the sand provides drainage and the larger pot allows for water circulation. Make sure your new pot has a drainage hole at the bottom, and place a layer of broken clay or stones over it. Do remember: the palm’s roots are sensitive, so take care! Areca palm ready to repot Areca palm should be repotted carefully as the roots are sensitive [Photo: LuxMockup/ Shutterstock.com] Pests and diseases The most common areca palm pests include: Mealybugs: form webs over the leaves that look like cotton wool. Scale insects: are very well camouflaged, so regularly check your plant. Spider mites: appear mainly in winter when the humidity in the room is too low. Why does the butterfly palm get brown tips? Cold, dry air or drafts: cause brown leaf tips. Direct sun: can lead to yellow-brown spots or dry, yellow leaves. Too much or too little fertiliser: can turn the leaves yellow. Excess water: is indicated by palm branches drying up completely. Tip: Your palm’s leaves may also suffer from chlorosis, which is where they lighten to a yellow colour. This is often caused by iron and magnesium deficiency which is lacking in normal potting soil and many fertilisers. As such, these trace elements should be added separately or provided via repotting. Areca palm uprooted for propagation The areca palm is easy to propagate from cuttings [Photo: LuxMockup/ Shutterstock.com] Propagating areca palm Areca palm produces offshoots that are easy to propagate. Separate the daughter plants from the mother plant and place them in a separate pot. Do this in spring when the growth phase is beginning. Make sure the offshoot has already formed its own roots and is at least 30cm long. Keep the offshoot above 20°C in a bright location, with moist soil. Initially, it may help to put a plastic bag with some air holes over the plant to increase humidity. Once the first palm leaves have formed, treat the plant like an adult, and, if necessary, transplant your palm again. Fertilise your plant only after the first four months, once the offshoot has time to form roots. You can also propagate areca palm from seed, but it takes longer. Sowing is best done in spring. Soak the areca palm seeds in water for about two days, before placing your seeds into all-purpose soil and lightly covering them with a layer of compost. Place the pot in a warm, bright place, and keep the soil moist and the temperature above 18°C. To increase humidity further, cover the pots with cling film or a plastic bag with a few small air holes. The seeds will only begin to germinate after about 40 days – so be patient!"

    "content": "The Ultimate Guide to Areca Palms: Everything You Need to Know Areca palms, scientifically known as Dypsis lutescens or Chrysalidocarpus lutescens, are popular houseplants admired for their graceful and feathery fronds. This comprehensive care guide will provide valuable insights and tips to ensure your Areca palm thrives and brings a touch of tropical elegance to your indoor space. Light Requirements: Areca palms thrive in bright, indirect light. Place your plant near a window with filtered sunlight, where it can receive several hours of gentle morning or afternoon sun. Avoid exposing it to direct sunlight, as it can scorch the leaves. If your plant leans towards the light, rotate it regularly to ensure even growth. Temperature and Humidity: Maintain a warm room temperature between 18°C and 24°C (65°F and 75°F) for your Areca palm. This plant appreciates moderate to high humidity levels. Increase humidity by placing a water tray near the plant or using a humidifier. Avoid placing it near draughts or cold air-conditioning vents. Watering: Water your Areca palm thoroughly, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. Ensure the water drains well from the pot to prevent waterlogging. Stick your finger into the soil to check its moisture level, and water only when it feels slightly dry. Adjust the watering frequency based on the season and environmental conditions. Soil and Potting: Areca palms prefer well-draining soil. Use a high-quality potting mix that retains moisture without becoming waterlogged. Adding perlite or coarse sand to the soil mix can improve drainage. Repot your palm every two to three years or when it outgrows its current container. Fertilising: Feed your Areca palm with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer diluted to half the recommended strength. Apply the fertilizer every two months during the growing season (spring and summer). Reduce fertilization in the winter when the plant's growth slows down. Follow the instructions on the fertilizer packaging for proper dilution and application. Pruning: Prune your Areca palm to maintain its desired shape and remove any damaged or yellowing fronds. Use clean, sharp pruning shears to make clean cuts. Avoid removing more than one-third of the plant's foliage at a time. Pruning is best done in the spring or early summer. Pests and Diseases: Areca palms are generally resistant to pests and diseases. However, they can occasionally be affected by common houseplant pests like spider mites or mealybugs. Check out our common plant pests blog here. Common Questions about Areca Palms: How often should I water my Areca palm?

    "content": "Prayer Plant: Care & Growing Guide With folding leaves, the prayer plant is a unique and easy-growing houseplant The prayer plant (Maranta leuconeura) is one of the most distinguishable tropical houseplants thanks to its beautiful decorative foliage. It gets its common name from its leaves, which stay flat during the day and then fold up like praying hands at night. A slow-grower, the prayer plant can eventually reach up to a foot in height indoors. They are popular as houseplants and can be planted and cared for indoors during any time of the year. Those looking for a pet-safe plant will be happy to hear that prayer plants are considered non-toxic to both pets and humans1. prayer plant Credit: The Spruce / Adrienne Legault Common Name Prayer plant Botanical Name Maranta leuconeura Family Marantaceae Plant Type Herbaceous, perennial Mature Size 6–12 in. tall, 6–12 in. wide Sun Exposure Partial, shade Soil Type Moist but well-drained Soil pH Neutral, acidic Bloom Time Spring Flower Color White Hardiness Zones 11-12 (USDA) Native Area South America Prayer Plant Tips for Beginners Where to Put It: Place your prayer plant in a spot that receives bright to medium indirect sunlight—too much light will scorch the leaves. How to Water It: These can be tricky to water. Give your prayer plant a good watering once or twice a week during the spring and summer, and once a week during the fall and winter. Soil Type: Prayer plants love well-draining, loamy, and acidic soil. Prayer Plant Care Prayer plants are low-growing, spreading plants that thrive best in tropical greenhouse-like conditions, including warm, humid airflow; well-draining, nutrient-rich soil; and regular fertilization. Poorly drained soil can cause the plant to die from root rot or collapse.2 Likewise, plants that are exposed to too much sun can become washed out and develop brown patches on their leaves.2 closeup of a prayer plant Credit: The Spruce / Adrienne Legault Light Bright to medium indirect sunlight will allow your prayer plant to thrive. Avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight which can burn this plant's delicate leaves. Prayer plants generally tolerate low-light areas but may develop leggy growth in very low-light conditions. In the winter when the plants go into dormancy, provide them with bright light to maintain growth. Soil Prayer plants require well-draining, loamy, and acidic soil to thrive indoors. Typically, a traditional potting mix works well, but you can also make your own by combining two parts sphagnum peat moss, one part loamy soil, and one part perlite or coarse sand. Water Keep the soil of your prayer plant evenly moist, watering once the top layer of soil has dried out. This will likely be once or twice a week during the spring and summer, and once a week during the fall and winter. These sensitive plants prefer filtered or distilled water where possible. These plants are very susceptible to drought and will not survive long if left unwatered. However, prayer plants are also susceptible to root rot and fungal problems if they are overwatered, so avoid waterlogging the soil and letting water sit on the leaves. Why Your Prayer Plant Has Brown Leaves Prayer plants can be sensitive to the amount of water they receive. If they receive too much or too little water, their leaves can start to turn brown and crispy around the edges. But pay close attention to your prayer plant—if the leaves are turning brown and you haven't changed your watering schedule, it could be a sign of pests like spider mites. Temperature and Humidity Prayer plants thrive in humid environments. Normal household temperatures (between 60°F and 80°F) are usually good enough. However, if you notice your plant could benefit from some added humidity, run a small humidifier nearby or place the plant on top of a pebble tray filled with water. Fertilizer Fertilize your prayer plant every two weeks from early spring through fall (reducing to once a month in winter) with a water-soluble houseplant fertilizer diluted to half-strength. If you use too little fertilizer, your plant will grow slowly or hardly at all. However, too much fertilizer can burn the plant's roots. Prayer Plant (Maranta leuconeura) Care Guide Credit: The Spruce / Amy Sheehan / Adrienne Legault Types of Prayer Plants There are many varieties of prayer plants, but the most popular by far is the tricolor variation. Prayer plants and calathea plants are so closely associated with one another that it's common for them to be mislabeled. Within the Maranta genus, a few species are the most common: Red/Tri-Colored Maranta (M. leuconeuravar. erythrophylla): This tri-colored prayer plant, also called the herringbone plant, is the most common variety and features bold red veins. Rabbit's Tracks Maranta (M. leuconeura var. kerchoveana): This variety has plain green leaves with two rows of darker splotches. Green Maranta (M leuconeura var. erythroneura): This variety looks almost identical to the red/tri-colored maranta, except it has white/lime green veins rather than red veins. Black Maranta (M. leuconeura var. massangeana): This variety has a darker leaf background with silvery blotches along the midrib and white leaf veins. maranta tricolor Credit: The Spruce / Adrienne Legault maranta leuconeura maranta leuconeura Tips for Buying In-Store Check for pests. Look underneath leaves and along the stem to make sure no critters follow you home. Avoid plants with brown spots on leaves. Read the plant label. Make sure that this plant works for you, your lifestyle, and your space. This one needs a lot of humidity. Pruning Prayer Plants Prayer plants do not require regular pruning, however, since they are a low-growing, creeping plant by nature, potted plants can become unruly-looking over time with long stems. Pruning can help to encourage a more bushy appearance. Additionally, pruning is a great way to remove leggy growth or leaves that have turned brown or yellow. To prune your prayer plant use a pair of sharp, clean pruning shears or scissors and trim off sections of the stem, cutting just above the leaf nodes. While pruning can be done at any time of the year, spring and summer are the best times to prune your plant to encourage new growth. Pruning Tip Looking for the best pruners to use on your prayer plant? We tested over 25 top-rated pruners in our Lab to make sure your houseplant stays happy and healthy. Propagating Prayer Plants The easiest and most common way to propagate prayer plants is to divide the plant while repotting. Here's how: Remove your plant from its pot and divide it into several smaller plants by gently shaking the soil off the roots and working them apart. Each new plant should have a good mass of roots and several stems. Pot these new smaller plants into shallow pots using a well-draining potting mix. Water the freshly planted prayer plants thoroughly, allowing the excess water to drain from the pot. Place the plants in a warm, humid location that receives bright to medium indirect light. Ensure the plants stay warm with soil that is evenly moist at all times as the plants become established in their new pots.

Pests to Watch Signs that probably indicate a spider mite or mealybug issue: tiny bugs on the underside of the leaves, browning leaves, or white powder on the leaves. Common Problems with Prayer Plants Prayer plants are generally considered easy to grow, however, since they prefer greenhouse-like conditions and frequent watering, it can be a challenge to get them accustomed to your home at first. As a result, it's common to run into a few problems including yellow leaves, brown leaves, and dropping leaves. Yellow Leaves Yellow leaves on a prayer plant are often a result of improper watering, a lack of sunlight, or too much sunlight. Watering issues can include both overwatering and underwatering. Overwatering can lead to root rot, which will eventually cause the plant to die from dehydration since it no longer has roots to absorb water. Yellow leaves can be an early warning sign that root rot is beginning. A lack of sunlight will also result in yellow leaves as the plant sacrifices leaves to preserve its energy. Similarly, plants that are exposed to too much sunlight can also develop yellow leaves, although the leaves will usually look more bleached and faded than truly yellow. Brown Leaves Brown leaves are another common problem that is usually due to underwatering, a lack of humidity, or a lack of sunlight. Sometimes, plants that are underwatered will develop yellow leaves that will eventually become brown, crispy leaves. Prayer plants that need more light will undergo a similar process. Plants suffering from a lack of humidity will often begin developing brown edges on their leaves, which can be an early warning sign that more humidity is needed. Dropping Leaves If your prayer plant begins suddenly dropping its leaves, there can be a few potential culprits. Extreme changes in temperature or humidity, pest infestations, drought, and excessive fertilization are the most common causes. These issues will cause your plant to go into shock and begin dropping its leaves. Closely examining your plant, its growing environment, and any recent changes it has been exposed to will help to determine what's causing the problem. Is This the Right Plant for You? A PRAYER PLANT IS A GOOD CHOICE IF: you want a beautiful houseplant that has just the right amount of color you are a pet parent and want a houseplant safe for them you won't forget to water once a week you have a spot that gets bright to medium indirect sunlight FAQ Do prayer plants need sun? Prayer plants need bright indirect light, and can take a few hours of direct light a day as well. Your prayer plant can burn if placed in direct sunlight. How do you tell if a prayer plant is happy? Your prayer plant is happy if the leaves are lush, verdant, and free of crispy edges. Dry, wilted leaves are a sign your plant needs more water. Are prayer plants easy to grow? Prayer plants are fairly easy to grow if the conditions are right. They should be watered on a consistent basis to prevent crispy leaves. Prayer plants are susceptible to spider mites, so if your plant looks unhappy but you don't know why, check the undersides of the leaves for tiny insects and webbing. Can prayer plants bloom? Yes, prayer plants can bloom when grown indoors under the right conditions. Mature and happy prayer plants will display delicate white and light pinkish-purple flowers in the spring and summer. Take this as a great sign that your plant is happy with its growing conditions!"

I wanted to write about this since they aren’t the easiest of plants to care for, but in no way impossible. But don’t expect them to be like a ZZ or Snake plant! I hope it’s helpful to others who might be thinking about picking one up :). Spoiler alert: I don’t keep them in a cabinet or grow tent! View fullsize My first Prayer Plant Maranta leuconeura variegated (this one is much less demanding than Calathea) My first Prayer Plant Maranta leuconeura variegated (this one is much less demanding than Calathea) My relationship with Prayer plants has been complicated. There’s definitely been low points, but that was my own fault, I didn’t take the time to learn how to make sure they were happy. I think they are worth the time and effort. Once the balance is figured out I don’t feel that they demand too much. I’ve never seen a prayer plant I haven’t immediately fallen in love with. Their leaves are all works of art. I’m always in awe and can’t believe the beauty of nature. View fullsize Calathea ‘White Fusion’ Calathea ‘White Fusion’ If you watch prayer plants throughout the day you will notice that their leaves move up and down (hence the name). One theory is that this movement is to maximize the capture of water. During the day they lower their leaves to absorb moisture and rain while at night the leaves move inwards to retain water and move any water to the center of the plant. Before I knew about this behaviour I used to swear I would see movement from the corner of my eye. I also would hear my partner say, “that plant just moved!” a lot, which prompted research. View fullsize Calathea ‘Ornata’ Calathea ‘Ornata’ Here’s how I’ve been taking care of my Prayer plants. Soil: I’ve been using regular potting mix. Soil should be able to retain moisture without being overly wet. Water: I use distilled water since chemicals in tap water can cause leaf tips to brown. I never let the soil completely dry out. I keep the soil moist but never too wet. I water when the soil is almost dry. Light: I have most of my prayer plants in medium light, where they are approximately 6-7 feet away from a south facing window. They get a little bit of morning sun, which is much more gentle. Direct afternoon sun can cause their leaves to burn. They are happiest in bright indirect light. Fertilizer: During spring and summer I use MARPHYL Organic Liquid Marine Phytoplankton Soil Enhancer every other week. Humidity: I keep most of my prayer plants near a humidifier (especially in the winter when the heat dries the air). I set it to around 65%. If you’re able to give them more I wouldn’t hesitate, but I’m not willing to set up a grow tent or plant cabinet in my office (at least not yet!). Certain prayer plants such as the Stromanthe ‘Trio Star’ and Calathea ‘White Fusion’ really need the humidity, while others such as the Calathea ‘Makoyana’ and Ctenanthe ‘Burle Marx’ are okay with less from my experience.

View fullsize Stromanthe ‘Triostar’ Stromanthe ‘Triostar’ From my experience prayer plants can be fussy, but in no way impossible. I had to learn how to take care of them, the first prayer plants I took home felt impossible. Without a humidifier and watering with tap water caused their leaves quickly go brown and crispy. It didn’t help that I thought they had thrips from the garden center (I’m still wondering if they did or if I was paranoid). I panicked and spayed they with an insecticidal soap that was too strong (Calathea specifically tend to have sensitive leaves). That was a recipe for disaster… I didn’t give up on them though. I got a humidifier and started watering with distilled water. It took some time but new growth started to show up and this time didn’t crisp up. They doing much better today (almost a year later) but I feel like they are still recovering. Hopefully this spring they make a full recovery. With a humidifier and distilled water they’ve done pretty well for me. From time to time I see some brown tips but for their beautiful foliage they are worth a little extra attention. But I’m not surprised since I’m not keeping them in super high humidity so that’s a trade off I’m willing to make.

Amy Grant's avatar By Amy Grant last updated May 15, 2024 Contributions from Laura Walters, Heather Rhoades in Features The prayer plant (Maranta leuconeura) is an easy to grow and exotic-looking houseplant that makes a great addition to any indoor garden. While it is generally a hard-to-kill houseplant, it does have specific needs. We'll dig into the basics of prayer plant care and look at exactly what growing conditions these plants need to survive and thrive, as well as how to plant and propagate them, and how to troubleshoot any potential problems. What Is a Prayer Plant? Quick Facts Botanical name: Maranta leuconeura Height: 12-15 inches (30-38 cm) Spread: 12-15 inches (30-38 cm) Sun exposure: Low light Soil requirements: Well-draining potting soil Hardiness zones: 11-12 When to plant: Spring The prayer plant is a clump forming, low evergreen grown for its lovely foliage. This tropical perennial is native to the rainforests of Central and South America.

Its elliptical to oval leaves are adorned with white or red veining, patterns, lines, shading and blotches. Even the underside of the foliage is decorative, ranging in color from gray/green to purple depending on the different prayer plant varieties. In the late spring to early summer, the plant blooms with white, purple spotted double-lipped flowers borne off of slender spikes. These blooms are fairly insignificant and rarely make an appearance on houseplants. Though when grown in ideal conditions, plants will bloom. Prayer plants nestled between other houseplants (Image credit: Firn / Getty Images) Maranta’s common name is derived from the habit of the plant’s leaves. They close upward at nightfall resembling praying hands. The Venetian physician and botanist, Bartolomeo Maranti lends his surname as the \"Maranta\" genus. While \"leuconeura\" comes from the Greek leuko meaning white and neura meaning string; a reference to the plant’s white leaf veins. Maranta vs. Calathea Prayer Plants Don't confuse the Maranta prayer plant with its relative, the confusingly named Calathea prayer plant. There are several key differences that will help you identify Calathea vs. Maranta plants. Gardening tips, videos, info and more delivered right to your inbox!

Since both plants have leaves with a somewhat painted appearance, the easiest way to tell them apart is to look at the plant's growth habit. Maranta is a vining plant and Calathea is shrubbier and grows upright. Calathea also often features more purple on its leaves, though this can change depending on variety. Prayer Plant Care As mentioned, prayer plant is a fairly low-maintenance plant, provided you can mimic its native environment. This means you must pay careful attention to humidity, temperature, and light. Light In its native region, the prayer plant thrives in a lower light setting. To copy their light needs inside, keep plants in partial shade, either in a shady window or protected from brighter light with a sheer curtain. However, beware of drafts by windows. Soil Prayer plants do best in a soil-based potting mix made for houseplants. These plants prefer well-drained soil and require high humidity to thrive. Prayer plant soil should be kept moist, but not soggy. During winter dormancy, the soil should be kept drier. Water Water prayer plants with tepid water to avoid shocking them. Keep soil moist during the growing period of March through September. In the winter, allow the top inch of soil to dry out before watering again. Avoid the use of hard water, if possible, as it will leave mineral deposits on the foliage or in the soil. Temperature & Humidity Prayer plants are intolerant of temperatures below 60 F (16 C) and will die if they experience frost. Ideal household temperatures for this plant are between 60 and 80 F (16-27 C). Dry air can be a problem for houseplants in winter. To combat this, place your prayer plant amidst several other houseplants to help create more humid conditions. You can also place a bowl of water near the plant or setting its container on top of a shallow dish of pebbles and water is also helpful. However, do not allow the prayer plant to sit directly in water. Fertilizer Fertilize plants with a standard, all-purpose liquid fertilizer for houseplants every two weeks during the growing season, from March through September. Don't fertilize plants during dormancy in the winter months. Repotting & Pruning Prayer plants do like to be somewhat root bound, so you only need to repot them every 1-2 years. Repot in early spring, at which time you can also propagate your prayer plant by division. Use fresh, well-draining houseplant potting mix when repotting. Girl repotting a prayer plant (Image credit: Ольга Симонова / Getty Images) Although prayer plants do not need to be pruned, trimming their vines just above a leaf node can create a bushier plant. You can also use these trimmings to propagate more prayer plants. Propagation Take stem cuttings from spring to early summer. Make cuts just below the nodes closest to the bottom of the stem. Then place cuttings in a mixture of moist peat and perlite and cover with plastic to retain moisture levels. You may want to poke a few air holes in the plastic to allow for adequate ventilation as well, then set cuttings in a sunny location. If a piece of prayer plant has broken off, dip the broken end into rooting hormone and place it in distilled water. Change the water every other day. Wait until the roots are about an inch long before taking it out to place in soil. Keep in mind with prayer plant propagation that there needs to be a least a small portion of stem on the leaves in order for the piece to take root. Alternatively, the piece can be rooted directly in soil, as with cuttings. Problems, Pests & Diseases Prayer plants can be finicky about humidity and water. Crispy, brown leaves on a prayer plant or dropping leaves are often signs of these conditions being incorrect. Check them out first. Prayer plants are also susceptible to several diseases. Cucumber mosaic virus results in distorted, yellowing foliage in a mosaic pattern. The only control is to destroy affected plants. In the future, aphids are a vector for this disease so aphid control is the key to CMV control. Helminthosporium leaf spot is another disease that can afflict prayer plants. Signs of this disease are small water-soaked leaf spots. This fungal disease is caused by overhead watering. Treat it with a fungicide. Root knot nematode stunts plants and galls roots. Infected plants should be thrown away. Tip burn is caused by phosphate fertilizer or fluoride toxicity from high light. It causes brown leaf tips and margins that will eventually die. Ease up on water and fertilizer and avoid superphosphate or perlite, which contain fluoride. Prayer plant with brown tips (Image credit: Ольга Симонова / Getty Images) Since prayer plants are also prone to pests like spider mites, mealybugs and aphids, it's a good idea to inspect new plants thoroughly before bringing them indoors. Occasionally check houseplants as an added precaution when watering or fertilizing for any problems. Ultimately, though, learning how to grow a prayer plant is easy and the rewards are well worth any issues you may come across along the way.

Close-up detail of fittonia plant on a white studio background Fittonias are attractive and easy-to-care-for houseplants that are native to the tropical rainforests of Peru and Ecuador. They have striking green and white or pink and white leaves, making them a popular choice for any home. Here's how to keep yours happy: Bright, indirect light is best, but avoid too much sun Water when the top of the soil feels dry Mist every few days, they love humidity About fittonias These adorable plants have little green leaves with bright veins, which can be all sorts of colours from white to pink to deep red. Nina, our 'white forest flame' fittonia, has snow-white veins. Fittonias are sometimes known as the ‘nerve plant’, because their veins look (a bit) like the human nervous system. Fittonias come from the South American rainforest, where they cover the ground with their lovely colour. A 'white forest flame' fittonia, a red fittonia and an orange fittonia in cream dipped pots on a mantlepiece in a living room How much light does my fittonia need? Fittonias prefer bright, indirect light. Direct sunlight can scorch its leaves, so it's best to keep it out of direct sunlight. How often should I water my fittonia? Water your fittonia when the soil is dry to touch, about once a week. Make sure to water the soil evenly and not just the top layer of soil. If the leaves start to droop, it needs more water. Does my fittonia need a humid environment? Fittonia likes high humidity, so mist it regularly or group it with other plants. You can also place it in a bathroom or near a humidifier. A white forest flame fittonia in a cream dipped pot on a mantlepiece in a living room What's the best temperature for my fittonia? Fittonia likes warm temperatures, between 18-24°C. Generally, if you're comfortable, they will be too. Should I fertilise my fittonia? Fertilise your fittonia once a month in the spring and summer with a balanced liquid fertiliser. They won't grow particularly big, but a good dose of nutrients will help them produce new leaves. Do I need to prune my fittonia? Prune your fittonia as needed to keep it looking its best. You can trim off any dead or yellowing leaves and stems. Snip off any particularly long growth if you want to keep yours compact and bushy. A red fittonia in a cream dipped pot on a mantlepiece in a living room When should I repot my fittonia? You can repot your fittonia every one to two years in the spring. Make sure to use a pot with good drainage and a potting mix that is specifically for houseplants. Can I propagate my fittonia? Fittonia can be propagated from stem cuttings. Take a stem cutting that is at least 4 inches (10 cm) long and remove the lower leaves. Place the cutting in a pot with moist soil and keep it in a warm, bright spot. Find out more about propagation here. Common fittonia problems Fittonias are prone to mealybugs and spider mites, so watch out for these pests. You can treat them with insecticidal soap. Overwatering can also cause root rot, so make sure to water it only when the soil is dry."

    "content": "How to Grow and Care for Nerve Plant Nerve plants (Fittonia albivenis) is commonly used as a potted houseplant for decor and livelihood. It is an evergreen perennial with deep green, egg-shaped leaves. Although the most popular vein color is a silvery-white, they come in a variety of colors including pink, red, green, and white. They are not tall plants, growing around three to six inches, but do have a greater trailing spread usually between 12 and 18 inches. They are slow to grow and rarely flower indoors. In a frost-free climate, nerve plants can be grown as a creeping ground cover in areas with filtered sun, and will bloom with significant reddish or yellowish-white spikes when the conditions are right. a fittonia in a multicolored planter Credit: The Spruce / Alonda Baird Common Names Nerve plant, mosaic plant, fittonia, painted net leaf Botanical Name Fittonia albivenis Family Acanthaceae Plant Type Perennial Mature Size 3–6 in. tall, 12-18 in. spread Sun Exposure Partial Soil Type Moist but well-drained Soil pH Acidic Bloom Time Summer Flower Color White, red Hardiness Zones 11 (USDA) Native Area South America Nerve Plant Care As beautiful as it is, never plant is somewhat temperamental and tricky to grow as a houseplant. Place it in a north-facing window where it can get bright, indirect light. Keep soil constantly moist. If stems flop over, that's a sign it needs water. Use a commercial potting mix for indoor plants that is peat- or coco coir-based. Nerve plant prefers relatively high humidity, though it should do okay in normal household levels. a fittonia plant Credit: The Spruce / Alonda Baird closeup of a fittonia plant Light As a tropical plant that naturally grows in the humid, bright shade of tropical forests, this plant prefers similar conditions when grown as a houseplant. It dislikes full sunlight, preferring bright, indirect sun, such as that offered by north-facing windows. It's can suffer from leaf burn in direct afternoon sun. Keep a nerve plant under fluorescent lights or near diffused light coming in from a sheer curtain. Another good location is in the bathroom, even if there's low lighting. Soil Nerve plant grows well in standard potting soil with a peat moss base. It prefers a slightly acidic soil pH. The soil should retain some moisture but should also drain well. Water Keeping a nerve plant appropriately moist can be a challenge. It is prone to collapse if it's allowed to dry out, and although it will recover quickly if thoroughly watered, repeated fainting spells will eventually take their toll on the plant. At the other extreme, nerve plants that are allowed to stagnate in water will develop yellowed, limp leaves. If you are unsure, use a moisture meter to help you determine when to water. Temperature and Humidity Nerve plant thrives at temperatures around 70°F but will tolerate a range from the low 60s to low 80s. These plants prefer humid conditions similar to those found in rainforests, so using a room humidifier may be helpful; they also do well in steamy bathrooms. Terrarium Plants Nerve plants thrive in terrariums. Other common terrarium plants to grow with Fittonia include ferns, polka dot plants, creeping fig, and spike moss. Fertilizer During its growing season, feed plants weekly with a weak dose of liquid fertilizer formulated for tropical plants. A balanced 5-5-5 fertilizer diluted to half strength is a good formulation. Types of Nerve Plant Cultivars of F. albivenis are divided into two different groups according to the venation of the leaves: the Argyroneura Group with white veins and the Verschaffeltii Group with red or pink veins.1 'Minima' is a low-growing variety, which makes it a preferred choice for a small terrarium. It has small, delicate green leaves with silver veins. ‘Pearcei’ has deep green leaves with bright red fishnet veins. 'Frankie' is a hybrid with light pink leaves that have dark brown, scalloped edges. 'Fortissimo' is another low-growing variety. It has vibrant green foliage with red and pink veins. 'Red Star' stands out with its deep red, broad oval leaves featuring that have frilled margins and pink-tan veins. Pruning Nerve plant grows quickly in the right conditions, and if the stems grow leggy, pinching off the tips will keep the growth full and bushy. Because the flowers are insignificant and boring, pinching off the buds will also help keep the foliage full. Pruning Tip Looking for the best pruners for your nerve plant? We found the top-rated pruning shears in our Lab to make sure your plants stay happy and healthy. Propagating Nerve Plant Nerve plants propagate readily from stem-tip cuttings, taken in late spring or early summer, at the same time you repot the plant. Taking stem-tip cuttings is the best way to propagate nerve plants; planting its seeds isn't as effective. Take cuttings. Make stem-tip cuttings at an angle using sharp pruners. (A stem-tip cutting is when you cut a piece of the stem that also includes the top of the stem where new leaves form.) Include at least two growing nodes on the bottom of the cutting to obtain the best results. Plant cutting. Bury the bottom of the cutting in a small pot, about 4 inches in diameter, filled with a peat-based soil mix. (Rooting hormone is optional.) Keep soil moist. Water the soil so that it's moist but not soggy. Place plant in a spot that gets bright, indirect light. Expect roots to grow within two to three weeks. Clean Your Tools When pruning a plant, be sure to use sharp, sterilized pruning shears. Open wounds on plants are especially susceptible to bacteria and could lead to infections and disease, especially when being used on multiple plants at once. Potting and Repotting Nerve Plant Any conventional potting soil mix and standard houseplant pot with bottom drainage holes will work for nerve plants. Repot annually in spring or early summer, always using fresh potting soil to prevent soil compaction and water-logging. Common Pests Insect problems include mealybugs and aphids. Infestations should be treated immediately. An insecticidal oil, like neem oil, works well—and keep affected plants isolated to prevent the bugs from spreading to other indoor plants. Pest to Watch Because nerve plant's soil needs to be kept moist, watch out for fungus gnats. Fungus gnats lay eggs in the soil, and larvae can do a lot of damage and kill the plant from the roots up. Sticky traps are a great way to get rid of fungus gnats. Common Problems with Nerve Plant Many of the problems associated with nerve plants are the same ones that affect other tropical houseplants. A nerve plant may appear to be dying but tweaking its environment often saves it. Leaves Turning Yellow When leaves turn yellow it's the result of too much water.2 Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. Leaf Drop Leaf drop is usually the result of cold temperatures or drafts. Try to mimic the tropical conditions where this species naturally grows. Dry, Shriveled Leaves This usually indicates that the plants are not receiving enough humidity, or are receiving too much direct sun. Use a room humidifier in winter when humidity levels drop significantly. Keep your nerve plant out of direct sunlight. Droopy Leaves Droopy leaves are usually a sign of a watering issue. Check the soil moisture level to determine whether your plant has been over or under watered. Dry soil and crispy, droopy leaves usually indicates underwatering. If you have been watering around or more than once a week, try scaling back to determine if overwatering is the source of your nerve plant's droopy leaves. If all else fails, try giving your plant a more humid atmosphere.

Nerve plants aren't difficult to care for, but they need lots of humidity and a warm climate; keep plants in areas over 70°F, away from drafts, and in a humid spot with moist soil. Where should you keep a nerve plant? Unless you live in USDA zone 11 or higher, nerve plants must be grown indoors. Because they require high humidity, they do well when placed in a bathroom, kitchen, or near a source of humidity like a humidifier or pebble tray. How fast do nerve plants grow? Nerve plants are slow-growing indoors. What are the benefits of planting nerve plants? Nerve plant is an attractive, pet-friendly, and low-maintenance houseplant. Sometimes it is touted for purifying air, but it would take far too many plants for this to be a noticeable effect. Do nerve plants do well in bathrooms? Nerve plant is an understory rainforest plant, so placement in a bathroom or beside a room humidifier is ideal; try to give it medium (50-60%) humidity.3"

    "content": "Complete guide to aglaonema care Prized for their beautiful foliage, algaonema are a highly popular and low-maintenance plant. Close-up detail of aglaonema 'silver bay' on a white studio background Aglaonema plants, also known as Chinese evergreens, are some of the most popular houseplants around. They’re easy to care for, and they come in a variety of attractive colours and patterns. With proper care, they can last for many years, adding beauty and life to any room. There are some easy ways to keep them happy: Water when the top two inches of soil feel dry They'll be fine in most light conditions, just avoid harsh direct sun Mist your plant once a week to stop the leaf edges from browning About aglaonemas The Chinese evergreen comes from South-East Asia, where you’ll find it modestly basking in the dappled light under large tropical trees. It spreads freely and can often be found covering large areas of ground. The name aglaonema is derived from the Greek ‘Aglos’, meaning bright, and ‘nema’, meaning thread, because of those variegated patterns on the leaves. There are a huge number of different varieties with colours ranging from silver and grey to red and orange. Our aglaonema family includes Clancy the aglaonema red star, Aggie the red aglaonema and Anna the aglaonema 'silver bay'. A red aglaonema in a black concrete pot on a bedside table in a bedroom How much light does my aglaonema need? Aglaonema plants prefer bright, indirect light, such as that found near a north or east-facing window. Avoid direct sunlight, as this can scorch the leaves. If your aglaonema is not getting enough light, its leaves may turn pale or yellow, but generally they'll be perfectly happy in most light conditions. How often should I water my aglaonema? Aglaonemas should be watered when the soil is dry to the touch. Water thoroughly, until water runs out of the drainage hole in the bottom of the pot. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out before watering again. Overwatering can cause root rot, so it’s better to underwater than to overwater. What's the best temperature for my aglaonema? Aglaonemas prefer warm temperatures, between 18 and 26°C. Try to avoid exposing them to cold draughts or extreme temperatures. A 'red star' aglaonema in a stone fractured pot on a mantlepiece in a living room What's the best soil for my aglaonema? Aglaonemas should be planted in a potting soil that's well-draining. A mixture of peat moss, vermiculite, and perlite is ideal. Should I fertilise my aglaonema? Aglaonemas should be fertilised every two to four weeks during the growing season (spring and summer). Use a balanced liquid fertiliser diluted to half-strength. Do I need to prune my aglaonema? Aglaonemas can be pruned to maintain their shape or to promote new growth. Prune back any leggy or overgrown stems to keep the plant looking neat and tidy. A 'silver bay' aglaonema in a blue fractured pot on a bedside table in a bedroom Common aglaonema pests Aglaonemas are relatively resistant to pests, but they can be susceptible to mealybugs and spider mites. Check your plant regularly for signs of infestation, like white cottony masses or webbing. Treat any infestations with an insecticidal soap. When should I repot my aglaonema? Aglaonemas should be re-potted every two to three years, or when the roots become pot-bound. If the roots are poking through the top of the soil or the holes in the bottom of the nursery pot, or are tightly packed, it's probably time to repot. Use a pot that is one size larger than the current pot, and choose a well-draining potting mix. With proper care, your aglaonema will thrive and bring beauty to your home for many years to come."

This truly is the perfect beginners plant or for those with low light conditions. The leaves are large and lush and bring a low-maintenance, tropical feeling to your interior. Chinese Evergreens have evolved over the centuries to have many color and pattern variations. They are most well known for having green with silver splashes, stripes, or speckles such as 'Maria' or 'Diamond Bay' Aglaonema. Some have colored stems, veins and leaf edges such as 'Red Siam' or 'Lemon Mint' Aglaonema while others can be almost entirely a new color like white, pink, or red such as in 'Red Star' or 'White Joy' Aglaonema. Although they can get 3 feet tall, Chinese Evergreens are slow growing and great for desks and shelves. If they do get larger, their rounded forms fill a corner very nicely. Their slow growth means they only need a larger pot every 2-3 years and they actually prefer a tighter pot space. They can also produce blooms if given enough light. They look like dainty Calla Lily blooms and are very subtle. Types of Chinese Evergreen There are so many forms of Aglaonema and I recommend them all! Here are five that I currently or previously have owned that all look very different. Silver Queen - The Silver Queen is one of the most common Chinese Evergreens. It has long and skinny leaves with dark green and silver swirled together. Mine is placed in my bathroom a few few from a west window that is fogged out as its in the shower. It has been thriving and even bloomed last year! Red Siam - This is a gorgeous option if you want a plant that gives you rich color year round! The leaves are rimmed in red, speckled in green and yellow, and the stems are pink. It prefers slightly more light than its fully green cousins. As a result, mine sits a few feet from a south window. Diamond Bay - This is an option that has very large, long, lance shaped leaves. The center of the leaves are a pale, silver-green color that is a little more than half the width and stretches end to end while the outer edges are a dark green. Mine is sitting a few feet from a northeast window. White Joy - This is a newer and more rare varietal with stunning bright creamy white foliage with a deep green leaf halo and sparse speckled green variegation towards the edges. This will need brighter light to maintain its vibrant variegation. Mine is sitting a few feet from an east window. Lemon Mint - This is the latest variety I have gotten and I am obsessed. It is one of my favorite leaf colorings I have ever had. Lemon Mint has silver blotches throughout the foliage with striking green and yellow veining. View fullsize'Lemon Mint', 'White Joy' and 'Maria' 'Lemon Mint', 'White Joy' and 'Maria' View fullsize'Lemon Mint' Aglaonema 'Lemon Mint' Aglaonema How to Care for the Chinese Evergreen A Chinese Evergreen can grow anywhere in your home with few exceptions. LIGHT: They can handle low light to bright indirect light and even thrive under artificial light which makes it an ideal plant for an office setting or you may spy it in your local mall. The varieties with more color (like the ‘White Joy’ Algaonema) or with more color variations, prefer a slightly brighter light than the other varieties. They will live in the lower light, they just may lose some of their color definition. To help your Chinese Evergreens continue to receive maximum light we have to keep them dust free. Clean their leaves with a damp, lint-free cloth that has not had any cleaning products on it. HUMIDITY: The Algaonema does like humidity but is not essential. I keep one in my bathroom and it seems to love it but it is not a requirement for success. If you live in a dry, desert climate then you may need to assist it with misting, I recommend a continous mister , a humidifier , or by placing it in a more humid room such as a bathroom, kitchen or laundry room. View fullsize'White Joy' Algaonema 'White Joy' Algaonema View fullsize'Silver Queen' Aglaonema 'Silver Queen' Aglaonema WATER: Chinese Evergreens like to thoroughly dry out between waterings and since they are drought-tolerant, they won’t hold it against you if you go too long. When you do water, water thoroughly and let the pot drain before placing it back in its saucer. If your plant looks droopy it’s letting you know it needs some water. When in doubt stick your finger in the soil an inch or two and feel how dry the soil is. During growing season water once a week while in winter you can extend that time. If your plant starts to get yellowing leaves that is a sign of overwatering. Let it dry out thoroughly before watering again. FERTILIZER: I fertilize my Chinese Evergreens every 4-6 weeks during growing season using a liquid fertilizer but do not in the winter. SOIL: Chinese Evergreens are not really picky. They dor prefer a slightly more acidic soil that drains well. If you find your soil isn't draining miz in some sand or perilite and make sure the pot has good drainage holes. View fullsize'White Joy' Aglaonema 'White Joy' Aglaonema View fullsize'Silver Queen' Aglaonema 'Silver Queen' Aglaonema Common Questions REPOTTING: Chinese Evergreens grow slow meaning they need a larger pot only every 2-3 years. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be repotting it in fresh soil back into the same pot, this keeps nutrients high. As a whole, Aglaonema actually prefer a tighter pot space. This also helps avoid root rot from excess soil. Don't worry, I did write a guide on repotting your plants. PROPAGATION: Division is the best way to propagate your Aglaonema. I like to target the newer shoots to avoid stress to the plant by dividing a major root ball. Slide it out of the pot and gently break away at the soil around the root ball. Identify a shoot that is on the edge of the root ball and tease it away from the main root ball. Plant it in a new pot. PRUNING: Your Aglaonema should be quite bushy but as it gets older it may start to elongate and drop some leaves. Pruning can help solve this. Trim the plant with clean scissors or shears below a leaf node which will encourage leaves to sprout from that area. PESTS & DISEASES: Aphids, whiteflies and mealybugs are the most common pests for Chinese Evergreen. Isolate your plant and use rubbing alcohol on a Qtip to get in the creases or Neem Oil. PETS: These are mildly toxic to humans and pets if ingested. That being said, I have five of these and my cats have never messed with them. FLOWERS: Mature plants that receive enough light may produce flowers in spring or summer. They look like spikes (called a spadix) with a creamy hood wrapped around it. This is very similar to a Calla Lily. Many prefer to cut these off so that plant can focus its energy on new growth.

Its large, glossy, lance-shaped leaves come in different color combinations with shades of green, silver, white, red, purple, and cream. Indoor plants rarely produce flowers. In the Chinese practice of feng shui, Aglaonema is thought to bring luck, prosperity, and success. However, keep in mind that these plants can be toxic to dogs and cats.1 an aglaonema plant by the window Credit: The Spruce / Leticia Almeida Common Name Chinese evergreen, Philippine evergreen, Poison Dart Plant Botanical Name Aglaonema commutatum Family Araceae Plant Type Herbaceous, perennial Mature Size 1–3 ft. tall, 1–3 ft. wide Sun Exposure Partial, full Soil Type Well-drained Soil pH Acidic Bloom Time Spring, summer Flower Color White Hardiness Zones 10–12 (USDA) Native Area Asia Toxicity Toxic to dogs and cats 1 Chinese Evergreen Care If you're looking for a beautiful, easy-to-care-for houseplant, Chinese evergreen may be the way to go. Beloved for its (nearly) hands-free care, the plant is simple to nurture. Plant Chinese evergreen in a well-draining potting mix. Place it in a location with indirect light and high humidity. A bathroom with a window is great. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. Feed with an all-purpose houseplant fertilizer during spring and summer. You can bring the plants outdoors during warm summer months if the weather consistently exceeds 55°F. agloanema receiving light by the window Credit: Leticia Almeida / The Spruce a closeup of aglaonema leaves shoots which can be used in propagation Light Darker green varieties of Chinese evergreens can grow in near-shade, while variegated varieties with lighter-colored leaves require a bit more bright light. Take care not to expose any variety to direct sunlight, as harsh rays easily burn the delicate leaves. If moving your plant outdoors for spring and summer, slowly adjust it to the sun over multiple days and choose a spot that's mostly shaded. Soil Typically, a well-drained, slightly acidic potting soil is perfect for Chinese evergreen. If the soil retains a lot of water, try mixing in sand or perlite to boost drainage. Houseplant potting soil mixed with perlite is a reliable combination. Water Chinese evergreen does not tolerate soggy soil and prefers to be on the dry side. Only water when the top inch of soil becomes dry. Frequency can be tapered off during winter months. Do not let your plant dry out completely. Temperature and Humidity These plants do not like cold drafts and don't tolerate temperatures below 55°F. The ideal temperature range falls between 65°F and 80°F. Avoid areas close to vents, windows, and doors where temperature may fluctuate. Chinese evergreen requires a consistently high humidity level. To increase humidity around your plant, consider placing it in a kitchen or bathroom, or on a pebble tray. If your home is particularly dry, invest in a small space humidifier. Fertilizer Feed Chinese evergreens with slow-release pellets or liquid houseplant fertilizer twice a year, at the beginning and end of their growing season. Or, you can fertilize it lightly every month or so in spring and summer with water-soluble fertilizer. Types of Chinese Evergreen There are several popular cultivars of Chinese evergreen, including: 'Frasher': Features milky green leaves, with cream variegation and white petioles. 'Pseudobracteatum': Leaves are spattered with green-gray splotches, with white highlighting on the veins. 'White Rajah': Foliage has broad amounts of white coloration. 'Red Zircon': Green leaves with pink blotchy sections in the center. 'Silver Bay': Silver tinges in the center of predominantly green leaves. 'Maria': A shade-tolerant variety with dark green leaves and silvery stripes. Pruning Keep your plant looking lush by removing dead leaves. You may need to reach deep down in the center of the plant. You can remove discolored or dead leaves with clean pruners. When stems become leggy, cut them back with a sharp, sterile tool just above the fourth or fifth leaf node. The pruned stem will produce new leaves, bringing foliage closer to soil level to create a fuller appearance. Spring or early summer is the best time to prune Chinese evergreen. Propagating Chinese Evergreen Chinese evergreens can be propagated using stem cuttings or by dividing the plants during repotting. Wait until summer when the weather is warmest. Stem Cuttings Use a sharp cutting tool to remove a stem several inches long. Put the cutting in a glass of water in a spot that receives indirect sunlight. Roots should form in three to four weeks. Carefully transfer your cutting to a pot filled with well-draining potting soil and keep it moist. Division Lay the pot carefully on its side. Use a trowel to loosen soil and gently pull the plant from the pot. Lightly shake dirt from the roots. Tease apart the roots to separate a clump for repotting. Repot the clump in a pot filled with well-draining potting soil. Keep both the original plant and the divided plant moist for a few weeks until both are established. Potting and Repotting Chinese Evergreen Any material will do for a pot, though it's common to use decorative ceramic or clay planters. Choose a spot that is only a few inches wider than the current pot. Repot them every two or three years in spring or when you see roots growing out of the bottom of the pot. Common Pests and Plant Diseases While not susceptible to many pests or diseases, Chinese evergreens can occasionally pick up a common houseplant issue like scale, mealybugs, or spider mites. These can be treated with neem oil. Most other issues arise because the plant is kept too moist. Fungal infections and root rot are typical of an overwatered Chinese evergreen. Common Problems With Chinese Evergreen Curling Leaves Free of most common problems, leaf curl is one caused by several maintenance errors. Temperature fluctuations, inadequate humidity, and underwatering all can cause leaf edges to curl up towards the center. Increase the humidity in the air around your plant with a pebble tray or humidifier. Keep it in a warm location free of drafts. Remove dry, brown leaves. Burnt Leaves Exposure to bright direct sunlight causes leaf edges to turn brown and dry. Move your plant to a location with indirect or filtered light. Yellow Leaves These plants prefer drier rather than overly moist soil. Let the top inch of soil dry out before watering. Choose pots no more than 1 or 2 inches wider than the rootball.

Aglaonema should not be placed in full sun, since they are vulnerable to leaf scorch. Give this plant bright but indirect light. The lighter the variegation on the leaves, the more light the plant needs. Types with dark green leaves will grow in part shade. Does Aglaonema like big pots? Aglaonema prefers to be slightly rootbound and a bit on the dry side. Choose a pot that corresponds to the size of the plant. Do Aglaonema plants like to be misted? Aglaeonema plants like humidity, but misting is not the solution. Misting a plant's leaves will only raise the humidity for several minutes.2 A small humidifier is better for increasing moisture in the air."

The larger Schefflera actinophylla features long, shiny, oval green leaves that droop gracefully from a central stalk, resembling an umbrella. Schefflera arboricola (dwarf schefflera) features smaller, glossy leaves, sometimes with creamy variegation. These easy-growing plants can live 25 years or longer and produce flowers, but plants grown indoors rarely develop flowers. Schefflera grows best in indirect light, requiring a rich, loamy, well-draining soil and temperatures consistently warmer than 60°F. All parts of the schefflera plant are mildly toxic to humans and seriously toxic to dogs and cats.12 Schefflera plant on a table Credit: The Spruce / Kara Riley Common Name Schefflera, umbrella plant, umbrella tree Botanical Name Schefflera spp. Family Araliaceae Plant Type Tree Mature Size 4-6 ft. tall, 3-6 ft. wide (indoors); up to 25 ft. tall (outdoors) Sun Exposure Partial Soil Type Moist, loamy Soil pH Acidic Bloom Time Summer (outdoors) Flower Color White, pink, red Hardiness Zones 10–12 (USDA) Native Area Asia, Africa, Australia, Pacific Islands Toxicity Toxic to humans, toxic to pets21 Umbrella Plant Tips for Beginners Where to Put It: Place your umbrella plant in a spot that receives bright to medium indirect sunlight. How to Water It: Only water when the soil dries out to prevent overwatering, likely once per week. Soil Type: Umbrella plants thrive in rich, well-draining, and acidic potting soil. Schefflera Care Here are the main care requirements for growing schefflera plants: Schefflera requires indirect, bright light. Growing in lower light conditions could result in less growth or the plant becoming leggy. Requires warm temperatures above 60°F at all times. Thrives in a rich, well-draining, acidic potting soil. Feed twice weekly during the growing season. Give water only when the soil dries out to prevent overwatering. Tolerates average indoor humidity at 30% but prefers higher humidity, preferably 40%. closeup of schefflera arboricola Credit: The Spruce / Kara Riley closeup of schefflera actinophylla schefflera arboricola Planting If growing indoors, place your plant by a bright window that gets indirect light as full sun can burn the plant's leaves. Plant with a well-draining potting soil and water when the top inch of soil becomes dry. Plant schefflera in the spring or fall when the weather is more mild and not too hot. If growing outdoors, you'll want to select a location that gets bright yet indirect light. Light Schefflera prefers bright, indirect light. In the summer, move potted plants outside where they will receive bright light but not direct sun, such as under a patio cover. A schefflera plant that gets leggy or floppy might not receive enough light. Never place a schefflera in direct, full sunlight because the intense sun can burn the leaves.3 Soil If growing indoors, plant schefflera in a rich, loose, well-drained potting soil. A well-draining, sandy loam soil with a slightly acidic pH is ideal when grown outdoors. Avoid planting outdoors where the soil becomes too wet or soggy. Water Water regularly during the growing season and spray the leaves with water frequently. Wait until the pot's soil dries out, then give it a deep and thorough soaking. Cut back on water during the winter months. Yellow and dropped leaves indicate that you might be watering too much. Temperature and Humidity Because it is a tropical plant, schefflera requires relatively high humidity and tropical temperatures; it will suffer in temperatures lower than 60°F. Do not expose these plants to drafts or dry heating vents. An underwatered or cold schefflera will begin to drop leaves quickly. If the plant loses all its leaves, you can attempt to save it by moving it outdoors in the spring and watering generously. Fertilizer Feed schefflera plants twice a week during the growing season with liquid fertilizer for houseplants, or use two applications of slow-release pellets. They are heavy feeders and will benefit from the extra nutrients. Is this the right plant for you? AN UMBRELLA PLANT IS A GOOD CHOICE IF: you have a spot that receives bright to medium indirect sunlight you can remember to water it every 1-2 weeks you don't have pets Types of Schefflera The Schefflera genus has about 600 species native to Asia, Africa, and the southwestern Pacific.4 Of the many species in the genus, two are common houseplants: Schefflera actinophylla: This most common schefflera has oval leaves that grow up to 10 inches from a central stalk. It can grow to 50 feet tall outdoors, but indoor they won't grow more than 15 feet tall. S. arboricola: This smaller version, popular in home gardens, has 1- to 2-inch leaves that grow in tight clusters; it is a variegated variety of this plant with creamy blotches on its leaves. It can grow as tall as 25 feet outdoors, but houseplants are generally kept to no more than 6 feet. Schefflera alpina: This variety can be grown as a small tree or a shrub and can reach up to 6 feet tall. It features glossy and dark leaves with pointed leaflets. Pruning Your schefflera might need to be pruned occasionally, especially if it is not getting enough light. Leggy schefflera can be pruned to encourage a fuller plant. Cut off what you feel is overgrown or appearing leggy (you can propagate the cuttings). Schefflera houseplants rebound quickly from pruning and will reward your efforts. The result will be a fuller and bushier plant. Pruning Tip Looking for the best pruners to use on your umbrella plant? We tested the top-rated pruners in our Lab to make sure your houseplant stays happy and healthy. Propagating Schefflera It's best to propagate schefflera in the spring by cuttings. Cut a piece of stem. Cut off a 6-inch stem section, making a 45-degree angle when you cut. Remove leaves. Remove the lower leaves, leaving four to five at the top of the stem. Dip in rooting hormone. Dip the cut end in rooting hormone. Plant in soil. Place the cut end in a container filled with a moistened potting soil. Cover with bag. Loosely cover the pot with a plastic bag. If it's pushing too much up against the plant, you can use a wooden dowel tied to the pot to help it stay up. Remove the bag for an hour or so every few days for air circulation. Place in bright light. Place the pot in bright, indirect light. After several weeks, gently tug the plant to see if it has rooted. If yes, you can remove the plastic bag and continue growing the new plant. Potting and Repotting Schefflera Repot schefflera plants annually or as needed with fresh soil and in a bigger pot if they've outgrown the previous one. You can slow the growth rate and prevent plants from getting too large by prolonging the period between repotting and allowing them to get somewhat rootbound. If you repot schefflera, remove it from its container and gently loosen up the roots; it can help to water the plant the day before repotting. To repot, select a container that's 1 to 2 inches larger in diameter with ample drainage holes and fill it with a peaty, well-draining soil mix. Overwintering As houseplants, schefflera can usually go longer between waterings during the winter. Once your heat comes on, check that the schefflera won't be impacted by any warm air or cool drafts. Schefflera plants are hardy in USDA hardiness zones 10 to 12, so in cooler climates outdoor plants must be brought in when the temperatures drop. Common Pests & Plant Diseases Both bacterial leaf spots and Alternaria leaf spots affect schefflera. These diseases can easily be remedied by avoiding overhead watering, not watering in the evening, and applying a copper fungicide if these watering practices don't work. Indoors, schefflera is prone to problems with aphids, which leave a honeydew excretion that makes the leaves sticky and leads to sooty mold; treat for aphids with insecticidal soap spray. Outdoors, the plant is susceptible to several pests, including mealybugs, spider mites, and scale insects. Pests to Watch Signs of these pests on your umbrella plant include webbing, white, cotton-y looking sections, or tiny bugs on the undersides of the leaves. Common Problems With Schefflera Schefflera is a low-maintenance plant that is not difficult to grow, but sometimes your plant can exhibit some problems. Here are some potential issues: Dropping Leaves Schefflera may drop leaves because it is stressed. When a sudden shift to its environment occurs, whether sun exposure, temperature, drafts, or watering changes, the plant will show its distress by dropping leaves. Check that the soil is sufficiently moist but not soggy. Ensure the plant has indirect light and temperatures remain consistently above 60°F. (Its preferred temperature range is between 65°F and 90°F.) Yellowing Leaves Overwatering is often the cause of your schefflera's leaves turning yellow. Try watering less to see if this helps. If not, your plant might not receive enough light, so move it to a brighter location. Brown Spots on Leaves Underwatering is likely the cause for spots on your schefflera. In that situation, water your plant more regularly during the growing season. Root rot, often caused by overwatering, can also cause brown, mushy spots on leaves. A best practice is to water the plant deeply and allow the soil to dry out before giving it another deep watering.

Schefflera plants can be left outside in the warm months in spring, summer, and fall as long as the temperatures remain above 60°F, the container has ample drainage holes during rainy days, and the plant is not placed in direct sunlight. It can be planted outdoors in the garden in USDA zones 10-12. Should I mist a schefflera plant? No, do not mist a schefflera plant—misting does not increase humidity. If your house is particularly dry, try adding a humidifier, which will actually raise the humidity. How long does a schefflera plant live? Indoors in ideal conditions, a schefflera plant could live 20 or 25 years. It could potentially live longer than that, but it might not look its best. At that point, it might be better to propagate a nice looking branch. How do you get a schefflera plant to branch? To get a schefflera plant to branch, cut the branch down to the point where you want it to start branching. The schefflera will send out multiple shoots at the location where it was cut, where previously there was one. Is schefflera toxic to pets? Yes, all parts of schefflera plants are severely toxic to dogs and cats; it's probably best to not bring one home if you have pets. It is also mildly toxic to humans. How big does schefflera get? Indoors schefflera plants can grow to 4- to 6-feet tall, getting their name umbrella tree. You're more likely to get to that height if you buy a big schefflera. Don't count on one in a 4-inch pot getting to that size."

One of the reasons the plant is popular is because schefflera plant care is so easy, but, while schefflera care is easy, the plant does need to be cared for. Keep reading to learn more about growing schefflera and keeping it healthy and lush. Schefflera Plant Care Instructions There are two very important parts to proper schefflera care. The first is correct sunlight and the second is proper watering. Light - Schefflera plants are medium light plants, which means that they need bright but indirect light. A common complaint about schefflera plants is that they get leggy and floppy. This problem is caused by too little light. Making sure that you are growing schefflera in the right kind of light will help prevent leggy growth. On the other side, you do not want to place a schefflera houseplant in direct, bright light, as this will burn the leaves.

Close-up detail of a schefflera plant on a white studio background Schefflera, also known as the umbrella tree, is a popular houseplant for its lush foliage and easy care. Bali, our schefflera, comes attached to a moss pole or their own lava rock. Here's the lowdown on schefflera care: Let the rock tray or soil dry out completely before topping up with water If your schefflera is growing on a lava rock, trim any roots that touch the water A schefflera will be happiest in bright, indirect light, but will tolerate a little shade Spritz your schefflera with a mister every few days About schefflera In the wild, this schefflera is most commonly found in Taiwanese forests, where it might grow as tall as nine metres. But don't worry, your houseplant won't get quite that big. Instead, growing a schefflera on lava or a moss pole looks very elegant and makes it very easy to look after. A schefflera plant on a lava rock on a bedside table in a bedroom How much light does my schefflera need? Schefflera plants prefer bright, indirect light, but they'll tolerate semi-shade. Avoid direct sunlight, which can cause the leaves to scorch. How often should I water my schefflera? Water your schefflera on a moss pole when the top inch of soil is dry. Allow the excess water to drain from the pot before returning it to its saucer. If you schefflera is attached to a lava rock, let the tray dry out and then top it up so it's about three-quarters full. It's actually the lava that absorbs water from the tray, not the plant. The plant's roots then absorb water from the lava rock. If you spot any roots touching the tray in the water, trim them back. This will stop your plant from sucking up too much water. A schefflera on a mosspole in a fractured pot in a bedroom Should I fertilise my schefflera? Feed your schefflera every two weeks during the spring and summer, its growing season, with a balanced liquid fertiliser. What's the best temperature for my schefflera? Schefflera plants prefer temperatures between 18-24°C. Keep yours away from cold draughts. It will love somewhere warm and steamy, like a kitchen or a bathroom. Do I need to prune my schefflera? Prune your schefflera as needed to keep it looking tidy. Remove any dead or damaged leaves and stems. A schefflera plant on a lava rock on a desk in a home office or study When should I repot my schefflera? If your schefflera is growing on lava, you just need to keep pruning and trimming it as it goes, it won't need repotting. For a schefflera growing on a moss pole, you can repot your schefflera every two to three years, or when it outgrows its current pot. If your schefflera has roots growing out of its nursery pot, it's probably time to repot. Common schefflera pests Watch for signs of pests, like aphids, mealybugs, scale, and spider mites. Treat with an insecticidal soap or horticultural oil and regularly clean your plant with a damp cloth. Following these care tips will help keep your schefflera looking its best. With proper care, your schefflera can provide years of lush, tropical foliage."

Learn all about your Schefflera’s needs and concerns. Schefflera arboricola in a pot For a compact growth the Schefflera needs to be pruned [Photo: Jana Milin/ Shutterstock.com] Water and nutrients are the umbrella plant’s (Schefflera arboricola) two most basic needs. The occasional pruning also benefits the plant and promotes bushy growth. Read on to learn more about umbrella plant care, including tips on recognising when it is time to repot your Schefflera. This article focuses on the dwarf umbrella tree, also known as umbrella plant and dwarf schefflera. For other Schefflera species, such as the more demanding false aralia (Schefflera elegantissima), visit our overview article on Schefflera. Contents Schefflera care In order for your Schefflera to grow strong, the right care and environment are important. Regular watering and fertilising are key to keeping your plant happy and healthy. Umbrella plants tolerate the occasional dryness better than too much moisture. Allow the soil to dry between waterings, and check if it is dry to the touch before watering again. Hard water can lead to calcium build up on a Schefflera’s leaves, hindering its ability to absorb nutrients. So, opt for soft water or rainwater if possible. Watering umbrella plants by the immersion method has been proven to be effective. To do this, briefly immerse the plant’s pot in a bucket of water until no more air bubbles rise up. Be sure to let the soil drain well before returning the umbrella plant back to its place. Using a cotton pad to wipe over the Schefflera leaves The leaves should be wiped off from time to time [Photo: Surkova.photo/ Shutterstock.com] Tip: To help your Schefflera retain its beautiful lustre, mist it with calcium-free water, and wipe the dust off the leaves from time to time. Apart from during their dormant period in winter, umbrella plants need nutrients every two weeks for healthy growth. A liquid plant fertiliser, such as our Plantura Liquid Houseplant Food, works wonders and is easy to apply. Our organic fertiliser helps Schefflera plants to grow magnificent leaves and also supports the roots, ensuring that the plant stays strong and healthy. To apply, simply dilute some of the liquid fertiliser into water and water as usual. This ensures that the nutrients are evenly distributed in the soil and quickly available to the plant.

Pruning umbrella plants If your Schefflera gets too big, it can be cut back without a problem. The best time of year to prune umbrella plants is in spring, but it is also possible to prune later in the year. That said, we explicitly advise against pruning umbrella plants during the winter months. When pruning, remove crooked, leafless or troublesome shoots. Always cut just above a node or branch fork. If the cutting is healthy, you can go ahead and use it to propagate your Schefflera. Schefflera branching: To encourage bushier growth, shorten the shoot ends to the desired height. Your umbrella plant will sprout more shoots from where the cut was made, which will give your plant a fuller look.

As Schefflera plants grow quickly, young plants usually need to repotting annually. We recommend repotting older umbrella plants every two to three years. Prepare your umbrella plant’s new pot by adding a drainage layer and then a layer of soil. We recommend using a high quality soil, such as our Plantura Organic All Purpose Compost. This soil retains its structure for a long time, stores water well and gradually releases nutrients to the plant.

To encourage your Schefflera to grow larger, choose a pot one size up from the last when repotting. To repot, carefully lift the plant out of its old pot, and remove the old soil from its roots. Cut off any rotten or dead parts of the roots. To limit the growth of your umbrella plant, cut back the roots a little more generously. Either way, be sure to cut back the shoots to the same degree that you trim the roots. The ratio of the plant’s roots to its crown must be balanced so that the roots can effectively support the crown. Once trimmed, put the Schefflera in its new pot, and fill the pot with soil. A person repotting the Schefflera plant If the old pot is well rooted, a larger one should be used when repotting [Photo: Bojani/ Shutterstock.com] Schefflera leaf loss: causes and solutions Is your Schefflera dropping leaves? This could be due to several reasons. Once you have identified the cause, take action to prevent further leaf loss and cut back the bare or damaged shoots the following spring. Temperature: keeping your umbrella plant somewhere too cold can cause leaf loss. Schefflera should never be exposed to temperatures below 10°C. To overwinter your Schefflera, place it in a spot with temperatures around 12°C. Draught: umbrella plants placed near open windows may also lose leaves. Protect your umbrella plant from draughts by placing it in a bright, sheltered place. Waterlogging: waterlogging can cause root rot in Schefflera plants. Root rot causes the plant to shed the leaves that are no longer getting water or nutrients. If the substrate is wet or if you notice a musty smell coming from it, your umbrella plant likely has root rot. To save your plant, repot it into fresh soil and remove rotten roots. In the future, water more sparingly and less frequently. Lack of light and heat: the combination of too little sunlight and too little heat can also cause umbrella plants to shed leaves. Schefflera need as much light as possible, especially in winter. In summer, on the other hand, when daylight hours are longer and the sun more intense, a semi-shaded spot will do. Schefflera plant on the window sill The Schefflera is losing leaves? A draughty window could be the cause [Photo: Africa Studio/ Shutterstock.com] Common umbrella plant pests Improper care and a poorly chosen location are not the only things that can affect a Schefflera plant’s growth. There are also a handful of pests that are fond of umbrella plants, especially in winter. Spider mites: brown, orange and red spider mites can find their way onto the plant. They feast on the surface cells of leaves, leaving behind tiny silver dots and weaving fine webs. Scale insects: these armoured pests are found at the base of leaves and favour spaces with dry air. Scale insects produce sticky honeydew, and their larvae feed on plant sap. Mealybugs: these pests also feed on plant sap and form honeydew. Mealybugs are covered with white filaments and hide under leaves or in leaf axils. Aphids: aphids are typically found on fresh shoots sucking out the plant sap. This causes the leaves to curl or grow misshapen.

    "content": "How to Grow and Care for Hoya Plant Porcelain Hoyas, also called wax plants, are an Asian native plant with fragrant, low-maintenance tropical flowers that grow in a ball-shaped cluster. These low-maintenance plants produce woody stems with waxy leaves, which remain evergreen. You can train a hoya plant as a vine or allow it to trail. Either way, expect the full length or height of the plant to be 2 to 4 feet. Hoyas require bright, indirect sunlight for up to six hours daily and moist, well-draining soil that should dry out between waterings. Common Name Hoya, wax plant, wax flower, Indian rope plant, porcelain flower, honey plant Botanical Name Hoya carnosa Family Apocynaceae Plant Type Succulent, perennial Mature Size 12-20 ft. Sun Exposure Partial Soil Type Well-draining Soil pH Acidic, neutral Bloom Time Spring, summer, fall Flower Color Yellow, orange, pink, white, purple Hardiness Zones 8-11 (USDA) Native Area Asia, Australia Hoya Care Here are the main care requirements for growing hoyas: Plant outside in spring or early summer in a spot with bright, indirect light. Place your hoya plant in a hanging basket or allow it to cling to a small trellis, providing a vertical accent in your tropical container garden. Give the hoya plant humid conditions, which can include placement next to a pond, fountain, or other water feature. Prefers moderately moist, well-draining soil; allow it to dry out between waterings. Give balanced, slow-release fertilizer once monthly. Hoya plant with pink cluster of flowers next to tree Credit: The Spruce / Gyscha Rendy Hoya plant with pink star-shaped flowers clustered together closeup Hoya plant flower buds on end of stem Hoya plant with leaves and tall stems with pink flower clusters in a white pot Light Hoyas thrive best when they get bright, non-direct sunlight for at least two to six hours per day. Soil Hoyas like to be planted in a well-draining, lightweight soil mix with a slightly acidic to neutral pH (6.1-7.5). Water Hoyas should be watered weekly and left to dry completely between waterings. If they get too much moisture, the roots will rot. Temperature and Humidity As a tropical plant, hoyas thrive in warm and moist, humid climates. Typical room temperature is appropriate for these plants, but you may need to supplement humidity. Consider using a humidifier or placing your hoya in a humid room, such as a bathroom, if there is enough light. Fertilizer Hoyas should be fertilized monthly; The International Hoya Association suggests feeding them with a fertilizer that includes nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Types of Hoya Plants Hoya is an Asian native plant introduced by Scottish botanist Robert Brown and named in honor of the 18th-century botanist Thomas Hoy. H. carnosa: Light pink flowers with dark, green leaves that trail. H. archboldiana: Cup-shaped creamy flowers with a maroon corona. H. compacta 'Indian Rope': Pale pink flowers and curly leaves; pretty even when the plant isn’t blooming. H. cumingiata: Yellow flowers with red corona; fragrant. H. kerrii variegata 'Sweetheart Plant': Heart-shaped foliage with white margins; yellow and orange flowers. H. onychoides: Purple flowers with an exaggerated star shape. H. australis: Rounded, oval-shaped leaves, long climbing vines, and fragrant white flowers. Pruning Hoyas are slow to moderate growers. When your hoya plant finishes blooming, leave the flower stalk, as it may produce new flowers. Removing the stalk forces the plant to produce a new stalk, which delays blooming and wastes the plant’s energy. Hoyas are light feeders, and a monthly drink of compost tea or diluted fish emulsion provides all the nutrition these tropicals need. Propagating Hoya You can propagate hoya plants by doing stem cuttings and rooting them in soil or water. They don't need much beyond the well-draining soil and the warm, humid conditions many tropical flowers crave. You can grow the hoya outdoors if you live in USDA growing zones 10-12; elsewhere, you must grow it as a tropical container plant or greenhouse specimen. Choose a location with full to partial sun. Plants that receive less than half a day of sunlight may not produce flowers. Here's how to propagate via cuttings: You need pruners, rooting hormone (optional), potting soil, a hand shovel, and a sterile container. Take a 4-inch cutting from softwood, cut on a diagonal with at least two leaves at the top. The cutting should have at least two nodes for roots to grow from. Optionally, dip the cut end in the rooting hormone mixture. Place the cut end down in a glass of filtered water. After about four weeks, roots should appear. Plant the roots in moistened potting mix and place them in a spot that gets at least six hours of sunlight. How to Grow Hoya Plants From Seed Seeds may be started in pots or flats. Here's how to propagate from harvested or fresh seeds: You'll need a good quality soilless potting mix enriched with perlite or pumice, a potting container or flat, and a clear plastic bag. Make inch-deep holes in the potting mix, place one seed, and cover over with a thin layer of potting mix. Lightly moisten the soil and cover the tray with a plastic bag to give the plant a humid, greenhouse-like atmosphere. The seeds should germinate within seven to 10 days. Once the plant develops true leaves, after about a month of growth, repot it. Potting and Repotting Hoya Hoyas like the security of a snug pot, and plants that are a bit root-bound will flower more prolifically than those in a giant pot. Hoyas don’t like wet feet or heavy soil. Many grow as epiphytes in nature (similar to bromeliads and orchids). Mix your regular potting soil with orchid potting mix in a 1-1 ratio to provide an ideal growing medium for your hoya plant. Also, when repotting, use pasteurized soil or growing medium in either new pots or those washed in a chlorine bleach solution and water. Overwintering Hoya plants will survive winter in zones 10 and above without any special overwintering care. In cooler zones, hoyas can only be placed outdoors during spring and summer when nighttime temperatures stay above 50°F. Common Pests and Diseases Hoyas are vulnerable to sap-sucking pests like aphids, mealybugs, and spider mites. All can be controlled with neem oil. Once you've treated the plant, wipe away pest residue with a clean, soft cloth. Fungal infections are also common diseases for the hoya. Botrytis blight can cause rot and kill your plant; it shows up as greyish patches. Treat with fungicide, and repot in sterilized potting medium. How to Get Hoyas to Bloom Hoyas are reliable warm-weather bloomers, but they need the right soil, ample light, adequate water and humidity, and nutrients. Fertilizer higher in phosphorus tends to improve bloom. It can also take two to seven years to reach maturity and bloom. Bloom Months Hoyas can bloom from June through September. How Long Do Hoya Plants Bloom? Hoya flowers last for about a week. What Do Hoya Flowers Look and Smell Like? Hoya flowers grow in a ball-shaped cluster or umbel, similar to mophead hydrangeas. Each cluster may contain up to 40 individual flowers packed tightly together. The individual flowers look perfect as if molded from wax or porcelain, thus their common names. Flowers often sport a colored eye in the center of the corona. The flowers have a sweet smell, varying from vanilla to citrus. How to Encourage More Blooms To encourage more blooms, ensure the soil is well-draining, the plant has at least six hours of light, has moderately moist soil, and is protected against insects and disease. Also, keep the plant root bound, it encourages flower production. Deadheading Hoya Flowers Never deadhead hoya flowers. Cutting off the spurs, where the flowers bloom from, damages the flowering part of the plant, and it will not bloom again the following year. Common Problems With Hoya Plants Hoya plants are tropical plants, so mimicking their ideal conditions can be tricky. The most common problems arise from not getting their growing environment right. Leaf Drop, Leaf Blackening, Stem Dieback Overwatering can be one of the biggest problems, causing root rot. Also, not providing a warm enough environment can be equally problematic. Each of these problems can cause a plant to shed its leaves, leaf blackening, or stems to appear to die. Overwatering can also make leaves turn yellow and droop. You can rescue or save a dying plant by correcting the water, humidity, and temperature conditions. Wilting Overwatering can also cause wilting, but so can too much fertilizer, making the roots unable to absorb water. If your plant has excessive salts in the soil, flush it with water thoroughly. Withhold giving fertilizer; instead, after a month or two, try giving compost tea or compost top dressing. Lanky, Straggly Growth If your plant begins to look stringy, it's possible it does not have enough light and is looking for more. Plants stretch out in search of more light. Move your plant closer to more light or, if growing indoors, give your plant a fluorescent grow light.

Hoyas can live up to 30 years indoors with proper care and managing its environmental conditions, such as lighting, water, fertilizer, soil, and humidity. Where is the best place to put a hoya? If grown indoors, place a hoya plant in a northern-facing window. Ensure it gets partial sun; full sun will be too strong for this plant. What is a hoya plant's growth rate? Hoyas grow at a slow to moderate pace, depending on the growing conditions being ideal. On average, they reach maturity within three to five years, although some plants may reach it a year sooner or a few years later. Why did my hoya plant stop growing? Plants get stressed out and can stop growing. Also, the coming of winter makes the plant slow its growth. To encourage growth, fertilize your hoya plant, and also make sure it has ample light."

Here we will introduce you to some waxplant species and give you our top tips on growing and caring for them. Waxplant white flower cluster Wax flowers are native to Asia and Australia; in our country they are popular houseplants [Photo: kawephoto/ Shutterstock.com] Discover more Houseplants flower trees plants plant Plantura succulent shrubs houseplant Houseplant The waxflower is an evergreen houseplant. It forms small, star-shaped flowers with a distinctive wax-like shimmer which come in different colours depending on the species. Contents Hoya: flower, characteristics, and origin Hoya, also known as the wax flower or porcelain flower, is a genus belonging to the subfamily Asclepiadoideae, in the family Apocynaceae. Hoya plants are found widespread in nature from Asia to Oceania. The evergreen houseplants grow partly in the ground and partly epiphytically (perched on other plants). Wax flowers are not parasites, however, but take root in old, already decaying bark. The plants form aerial roots, have very low nutrient requirements, and are good at storing water. They prefer high humidity because they would otherwise dry out quickly. Hoya is an herbaceous plant that only becomes slightly woody and is often grown on round arches because of its flexibility. The plant grows vigorously, and its shoots can grow several metres long. Some species grow like vines, others more like shrubs. Because of their overhanging growth, they are ideal for hanging baskets. Some species have a climbing growth with adventitious roots (plant roots are formed from any non-root tissue). Wax plant in pot with climbing support Wax flower shoots can grow several metres long [Photo: aleksandr4300/ Shutterstock.com] Hoya plants flower between spring and autumn. Lots of individual flowers of about 1.5cm in size form large flower clusters. The individual flowers are star-shaped and, depending on the species and variety, pale pink, white, purple, or pale yellow in colour. The petals have a double structure: On the outside there are five fused petals, and inside there is another row of five fused, smaller petals. The second row of petals are often a different colour to the outer. In the very centre are the sexual organs of the flowers. The flowers of most species produce a sweet fragrance, secrete nectar, and have a waxy sheen. With their distinctive flower structure, hoyas belong to the group of pinch-trap flowers, which have an unusual pollination system. The waxy flowers use pollinia (sticky masses of pollen) to trap flower-visiting insects. When the insects free themselves from the “grip” of the flowers, they often tear the pollinia with them and carry it on to the next flower. The leaves are about 5 to 8cm long, slightly oval-shaped and pointed. They are dark green in colour, succulent (thickened to store water) and usually have a waxy, shiny surface. The most beautiful hoya types The genus Hoya is made up of more than 300 species of porcelain flowers. Here you will find a brief overview of the most popular species: Hoya carnosa is very easy to care for and is probably one of the most common waxflower species. It displays a fast, climbing growth and its leaves are usually dark green and glossy. However, there are also varieties with white variegated and twisted or wavy leaves. The flowers of this hoya plant have porcelain white or pink petals with a dark red centre. porcelain white waxflower petals with dark red centre The flowers of Hoya carnosa are porcelain white or pink in colour and have a red centre [Photo: Maurizio Callari/ Shutterstock.com] Hoya bella is a small, compact wax flower that has a branching growth. Its leaves are grey-green in colour and have a matt shine. The flower clusters are made up of white, star-shaped flowers with dark red centres. Hoya multiflora is distinguishable from other hoya plants by the shape of its flowers. The individual flowers are pointed to the sides like arrowheads. They are also larger and have one ring of white and one ring of yellow petals. The dark green leaves of Hoya multiflora are thin, oval, and slightly wavy. Pointed arrowhead shape of hoya multiflora The flowers of Hoya multiflora are particularly striking [Photo: Bionic07/ Shutterstock.com] Hoya imperialis has distinctive wavy leaves. The most striking feature of this species, however, is the size of the slightly forward-curved flowers. The individual pink-violet flowers are about 5cm in size and have a waxy sheen. The petals in the centre are white. Hoya kerrii, also called heart leaf or sweetheart hoya, is another particularly popular species. It stands out because of the beautiful heart-shaped form of its leaves. The flowers in most of its varieties are white. Planting wax plants Once you have found the right hoya plant for you and are ready to plant it, you will need to choose a suitable pot, soil, and location. The right location and soil for hoya First things first, each hoya species has its own individual needs. However, we have outlined a few of their common features here. To give your hoya plant the right conditions for healthy growth, place it in a sheltered, bright, and warm spot in your home. A windowsill, for example, works well for this, although you should avoid direct sunlight. This is down to the fact that in their natural habitat, wax flowers are found under the leaves of the trees on which they grow. Some hoya plants even prefer to grow in shade. Avoid draughts too. Wax flowers also enjoy high humidity, so spray the plants with a little low-lime water every so often. The ideal room temperature is 18 to 25°C, depending on the species. During the winter months, the wax flower goes into a kind of hibernation, so place the plant in a cooler spot with temperatures between 10 and 15°C. This promotes flower formation. When it comes to soil, hoya plants need good root aeration and drainage for healthy development. As epiphytes, most species of hoyas are used to having their roots well aerated. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as specially adapted “hoya soil” – so you will need to mix your own. Use a peat-free potting soil such as our Plantura Organic All Purpose Compost as a basis. To prevent the compost from compacting and to reduce the nutrient content, mix it with 30% expanded clay and 30% pine bark or orchid soil. This gives the soil better structure, while lowering the nutrient density and the pH value – perfect conditions for healthy hoya roots.

How to plant hoya Choose a pot with a drainage hole, as hoya plants are sensitive to waterlogging. If the roots are permanently wet, soil-borne pathogens quickly gather, which manifests in root rot. Remove the wax flower from its container and place it in the centre of the new pot. Now fill it up with your soil mix and press down. Recap: planting wax flower Location: a sheltered, bright, and warm place without direct sunlight Room temperature: 18-25°C Soil: mixture of potting soil (such as Plantura Organic All Purpose Compost), expanded clay, and pine bark/orchid soil Choose a pot with a drainage hole Hoya care Generally, wax flowers are low maintenance houseplants. Apart from regular watering, occasional fertilising, and repotting when the pot is fully rooted, there are usually no further care steps. hoya kerrii with heart-shapes leaves in pot The sweetheart hoya also belongs to the porcelain flowers [Photo: Paladin12/ Shutterstock.com] Hoya watering Water your porcelain flowers little and often during the growing season from March to October. After watering, wait until the soil has dried out before watering again. In winter, wax flowers need less frequent watering and smaller amounts of water. The latter is especially important if the soil is not permeable enough. This is the case, for example, if normal potting soil has been used. Hoya fertilising The same applies to fertilising the waxflower as to watering. During the growing season, fertiliser should be applied every three to four weeks. A liquid green plant food such as our Plantura Liquid Houseplant Food is ideal. This is applied with the water and provides your green plants with all the essential nutrients. Apply a dosage of 15 to 25ml per 5 litres of water. The porcelain flower does not need fertiliser in winter.

Hoya repotting Porcelain flowers do not only grow above ground, but their root system also spreads underground. Repot your wax flower as soon as it outgrows the pot. Choose a new pot just a few centimetres larger than the old one. Do this between February and March. Older wax flowers in particular are negatively affected by repotting, which results in reduced formation of new flower buds. So, try not to do this too often. When repotting, it is a good idea to prune – spring is also the best time for this. Hoya plant in pot with wet leaves Wax flowers should not be repotted too often [Photo: Andrey_Nikitin/ Shutterstock.com] How to prune hoya Only prune wax flowers when their growth becomes too spreading. New buds usually form again and again on the old flower shoots, so it would be a shame to remove them prematurely. If you still want to cut your porcelain flower because it is getting too big or is not growing in the shape you want, cut with scissors or a knife above a leaf axil so that the hoya plant can form a new sprout at this point. Hoya plant not flowering: what to do? Wax flowers react to different conditions by reducing flower formation or even stopping it all together. If this is the case, the cause may be excess nutrients, so use less fertiliser. Another reason for a lack of flowering can be that the winter temperatures are too high: Make sure to place the hoya in a cool spot during the winter period. You should also avoid pruning the porcelain flower, if possible, as it also forms new flower buds on old flower shoots. Last but not least, the wax flower should not be moved or turned once in the right location. Porcelain flowers usually set their flowers on the side facing the light. If you turn the plant before the flowers open, the buds may fall off. Propagate hoya from cuttings and offshoots Wax flowers can be propagated vegetatively in two ways: from cuttings and from offshoots. Propagation by cuttings works as follows: In spring, cut off approximately 10cm, only slightly woody shoot tips and shoot parts from the wax flower. Then put into pots filled with a moist, loose, and nutrient-poor soil in a bright spot without direct sunlight, for example on a windowsill. Our Plantura Organic Herb & Seedling Compost would be an ideal soil for cuttings. To make it even looser, add some sand, perlite or crushed expanded clay. At temperatures between 20 and 25°C and with regular watering, the cuttings will take root within two to three months. Planting hoya plant cuttings in new soil Porcelain flowers can be propagated from cuttings or offshoots [Photo: Stanislav71/ Shutterstock.com] Alternatively, the hoya plant can also be easily propagated from offshoots. To do this, fill a pot with the above-mentioned soil mixture and lower a shoot of the mother plant into it. This means that you carefully bend down a tendril and place it on the soil. At the point where the shoot makes contact with the soil, remove the leaves and secure the vine in place with a peg. Then shorten the tip of the shoot slightly. As with propagation from cuttings, it takes some time for roots to form. After this has happened and the shoot sprouts anew, the propagation has been successful, and the cloned plant can be cut off from the mother plant. As well as the vegetative propagation methods above, generative propagation from seed is also possible. germinated hoya plant seeds Wax flowers can also be grown from seed [Photo: PENPAK PROMLEE/ Shutterstock.com] Pollination is only carried out by specific insects – but you can assist in this process by using a brush to go from flower to flower and from plant to plant. Seed pods form, which eventually burst open. To prevent the seeds from being thrown far from the plant, wrap the pods in a fine net beforehand. The seeds can germinate for up to one month, so do not wait too long before sowing them. Spread the hoya seeds on a suitable soil mixture, but do not cover with soil as they are light germinators. Keep the soil moist. Cover the pots with plastic or foil to increase the humidity and prevent draughts. Place the seed pots in a warm place, around 20°C. Generally, the seeds germinate within a few days and quickly grow into small hoya plants. However, the speed of growth and development depends very much on the species. Overwintering wax flowers Wax flowers do not tolerate cold. Therefore, after flowering, it is best to place your wax flower in a bright spot in your home or conservatory. Ideally, the temperature should be between 10 and 15°C or a maximum of 20°C. If warmer than this, the plant will form long, flowerless winter shoots. Furthermore, do not expose the houseplant to strong temperature changes or draughts. During the winter months, water the waxflower little and infrequently. There is no need to fertilise during this time. rain shower on hoya plant Hoyas should be sprayed in summer, but kept dry in winter [Photo: Andrey_Nikitin/ Shutterstock.com] Is the hoya plant poisonous? Wax flowers are poisonous. Some hoya species are even considered highly poisonous in exceptional cases. Hoyas contain cardiac glycosides that are potentially life-threatening. However, because of the unpleasant taste, there have been no known cases of poisoning. Small amounts cause vomiting, which protects us from a life-threatening dose. Hoya carnosa can also trigger an allergic response. Allergy symptoms occur when susceptible people are in regular contact with the plants (for example, when pruning, watering, and repotting). Symptoms include, for example, rhinitis, eye redness, coughing, and asthma. In these cases, the allergen reaches the respiratory tract through the air. Other symptoms such as skin redness and eczema occur as a reaction to skin contact. If you experience these symptoms, consult a doctor and mention that you have wax flowers in the house. Whether the plant is the trigger can be checked with a blood test. If this proves to be the case, remove the plant from the house."

The String of Pearls, also known as the Curio Rowleyanus, is a unique trailing succulent. If I were to name one plant that has my heart, it would be this one. I think it is the most beautiful houseplant! The plant originates from the southern tip of Africa, and its uniqueness makes this plant a favorite for plant parents. String of Pearls is a creeping succulent that has green balls for leaves (they look like peas)! OUR LATEST VIDEOS Ad ends in 13 In this post, I am going to share some tips on caring for a string of pearls. I will also share some other species of this plant family at the end of the post.

Table of Contents Potting Light Watering Propagating Fertilizing Potting When you get a string of pearls from a garden store, what’s next? You will need some well-draining succulent soil mix, which you can buy at most garden centers. It has a mix of soil and sand. The sand helps aid in soil aeration and lets the water flow more freely through the soil. I also like to put some extra perlite in my succulent soil. Perlite is found in nature and is actually formed by volcanic eruptions. Perlite is great for helping your soil drain the water out faster, as well. For pots, get one that is about the same size (definitely not smaller) or a tiny bit bigger than the plastic pot that it came in (it will likely come in a plastic hanging basket). I like to use a terracotta pot or an earthenware pot. The most important aspect when choosing a pot is that it must have a drainage hole so the water has a way of escaping. If the water cannot escape the pot, then there is a good chance the plant could die due to being waterlogged. Next, mix up your soil with a couple of scoops of perlite and have it ready to go. Take your pot and put a little soil in the bottom. Next, carefully remove your string of pearls from the pot by gently placing your hand on top of the plant, slightly wiggle the pot until the plant pops out. You might lose a few pearls (leaves) in this process, but that’s OK! Place your plant in the pot and make sure the plant sits about even with the pot’s rim. I put the roots about 1 centimeter under the rim and the pearls are all on top of the rim. Don’t let the plant lay lower than the pot’s rim because water can pool on top of the leaves. The plant loves to drink up light and trail over the edge of the pot. Once you have the crown of the plant placed correctly, take the extra dirt and backfill around the plant. I like using a chopstick to push down the dirt around the plant. Once you’re done backfilling the dirt, the string or pearls will likely need untangling (especially if you have a long one). Be patient during this process. If I slightly tug on a stem it could snap! Carefully look for a whole stem and gently untangle it so it lays draping over the pot. I go around the whole plant until all stems are untangled. You will probably lose a few more pearls during this process too, but it’s OK! Note: Even though this plant has lots of amazing qualities, string of pearls plants are toxic for humans and pets if ingested. If a bead (leaf) falls off a stem onto the floor, then I will quickly pick it up so my dog does not eat them. Light The string of pearls likes a bright and sunny environment in your home. An east or west facing window will work great. I place mine right near a window so they can drink up lots of light. Try to avoid placing it near any vents or drafty parts of your home (near a door opening up in the winter, etc.). It will not like any kind of extreme air temperatures blowing on it. During the warmer summer months, you can also put it under a sun porch or covered porch to soak up bright indirect light. Direct sunlight could burn your plant, so try to avoid it sitting in the sun for hours on end or they will get scorched. When temps begin to drop, bring your plant indoors. Before you bring it indoors, always check for pests or bugs. When I was bringing in my succulents from our covered porch at the end of summer, I found a baby black widow hiding under a leaf. This has happened to me again a couple of years later! My lesson was learned quickly so thoroughly inspect any plant before you bring it back into your home. Watering Figuring out a watering routine and getting to know your plant’s schedule will really pay off. String of pearls do not like to get soaked or sit in water for long periods of time. I like to say that I “moisten” my string of pearls instead of watering them. This helps remind me that they don’t need excessive water. The plant has a shallow root system, so generally the top half of my string of pearls pot needs water. I use a small vessel with water in it and lightly water over the whole top of the plant. Overwatering the string of pearls will be the biggest killer to your plant. You can tell if a plant is overwatered by the leaves looking squishy or they lose their deep green color and become a bit translucent and soft. If you are shopping for a new string of pearls, be mindful of this. You’ll want a plant with deep green pearls and soil that is not waterlogged. Not sure when to water your string of pearls? It really depends on where you live and humidity levels. Dryer climates will require more water and vice versa. You can test the soil by sticking your finger in a part of the soil to check moisture levels or lift your pot to see if it has any weight from holding water. Make sure your water temp is lukewarm to cool (think of rainwater temp). The string of pearls will not tolerate extreme cold or hot temps when watering. They love to be watered frequently in the spring and summer months (during its growing season), but back off on frequent watering in the fall/winter months. The string of pearls likes to dry out but not be bone dry. How can you tell when it is bone dry? The dirt around the circumference of the pot will pull away from the pot. If this has happened, no worries, give it a watering and try to water your plant sooner next time to avoid the dirt drying out too much. If this happened multiple times, it could affect your leaves and plant’s root health. Another aspect of root health is root rot. This can be detrimental to your plant. Root rot happens when the roots stand in water too long and they eventually rot and die. It can be a very sad and slow death for a string of pearls. If you suspect that your plant has been sitting in water for too long and it might have root rot, pull it out of the pot to inspect the roots. If the roots are firm and grayish white, that is great. If they are mushy and look blackish, then your plant likely has root rot. If it’s not too far gone, you can try to snip the dead roots off and leave the healthy, firm ones. Placing the plant in fresh (not waterlogged soil) will help as well. What is the best kind of water to use? If you are using tap/city water, you can leave your tap water out in an open container for 24 hours so some of the chemicals evaporate. After 24 hours, the water is cleaner and healthier for your plant! Fluoride and chlorine can build up in your string of pearls root system, so this method of leaving your water out will pay off in the long run. Using filtered water or collected rain water (if you can) is a great option, too! If you have well water, then your plant will love that. My friends who have well water have THE best plants. Propagating You can propagate the string of pearls three ways! The first way is by using water. First, find a healthy stem. I like to use stems that are at least 4-5 inches. Using clean scissors or cutting shears, cut your stem. Remove any beads about 1.5-2 inches from the bottom of the cutting. Leave the stem laying out for 24 hours so the fresh cut on the end of the stem can form a callus. Make sure it stays out of any sunlight during this healing period. After 24 hours, place your fresh cutting in water. The side of the cutting with the removed leafs can be placed in the water. Keep the remaining pearls above the water line. Be sure to change water anytime it gets cloudy and rinse out your vessel. Place in a sunny spot in your home. After 3-4 weeks you should see little roots sprouting from the cutting! Wait until the roots are at least 1 inch long before you plant it in dirt. Once it is ready to be potted, use a small terra-cotta or clay pot with good draining cactus/succulent soil. I like to use a chopstick to create little holes for the newly rooted plant. Moisten lightly and your plant should start growing. The next way to propagate is by using dirt. Using the same methods as above, you will snip your plant, wait 24 hours, and instead of placing it in water, place your plant in soil (well draining, succulent soil). Use a chopstick (or pencil) to create a fresh hole for your new cutting, tuck the dirt around the plant. I like to mist my plant to keep the soil slightly moist and not bone dry. After about three weeks, I give the plant a very gentle tug to see if it is rooting. If the new cutting stays in place, then I know new roots are forming. This is always exciting! If your plant has started to form roots, then it is ready for a watering. Another way to propagate your string of pearls is by layering. I find this approach to be the most effective. Take a fresh pot of succulent soil, mist it, and then take a good long cutting from your string of pearls. Swirl or coil the cutting over the top of the dirt on the pot. Fertilizing I like to fertilize my plant once a month during the growing season (spring and summer) using a balanced fertilizer. I use half of the manufacturer’s recommended rate when I mix my fertilizer. I love liquid fertilizer because it mixes so easily with the water and I don’t have to worry about it not being evenly distributed in my plants. One thing I love about this species of plant is the different varieties. Pictured above is “String of Turtles”—the turtles look like little turtles backs. “String of Watermelons” are plump and their leaves resemble a watermelon (pictured below)."

    "content": "How to Grow and Care for String of Pearls Plant String of pearls plants are unique vining succulents that are easily recognizable by their tiny pea-shaped leaves. The leaves grow on trailing stems that gracefully spill over the sides of planters and hanging baskets much like the string of rubies succulent. The plant is a robust and quick grower—gaining about five to 15 inches per year—but does not live long without propagation. Thankfully it is easy to propagate the plant using its stems. Though typically cultivated globally year-round as a hanging plant, in its east African natural desert habitat, string of pearls plants are terrestrial and form a ground cover. You can plant it any time but will have the most success in the warmer months. In addition to its unique sphere-like leaves, the string of pearls produces white flowers in spring with a pleasant cinnamon-like scent; although, it rarely flowers indoors. This plant is toxic to humans and pets.12 string of pearls plants Credit: The Spruce / Kara Riley Common Name String of pearls, string of beads, string of peas, rosary vine Botanical Name Curio rowleyanus (formerly Senecio rowleyanus) Family Asteraceae Plant Type Succulent Mature Size 1-2 ft. tall and long Sun Exposure Full, partial Soil Type Sandy, well-drained Soil pH Neutral, acidic Bloom Time Summer Flower Color White Hardiness Zones 9-12 (USDA) Native Area Africa Toxicity Toxic to humans and pets21 String of Pearls Plant Tips for Beginners Where to Put It: Place your plant in a spot where there's direct sunlight in the morning and indirect light in the afternoon. How to Water It: Make sure to water it enough so the soil is moist during the growing season and cut back on watering during the winter months. Soil Type: Aim to choose a sandy soil and place them in well-draining containers. String of Pearls Care String of pearls plant is not particular about its conditions and it will grow quite vigorously in a single season. Here are the main care requirements: Plant in a succulent or cactus potting mix. Place in a location where it gets direct sunlight in the morning and indirect light in the afternoon. Water just enough to keep the soil moist during the growing season. Reduce watering in the winter months. Avoid temperatures below 50ºF and rooms with high humidity. Feed regularly during the spring and summer months. closeup of string of pearls Credit: The Spruce / Kara Riley closeup of string of pearls closeup of string of pearls Light String of pearls plants thrive on a combination of direct and indirect sunlight, totaling between six and eight hours a day. They're best when kept in direct sunlight during the softer morning hours, then moved to a spot that gets diffused, indirect light, or partial shade during the harsher afternoon hours. Soil Any regular succulent potting soil is acceptable for your string of pearls plants, but sandy soil is best. A good choice for this plant is a cactus potting mix. Alternatively, use a three-to-one mixture of potting soil to sharp sand. These plants are susceptible to root rot, so make sure their soil is well-draining.3 Plant them in a container that boasts ample drainage holes at its base. Terracotta or clay pots also help wick away excess moisture from the soil. Water In spring and summer keep string of pearls' soil lightly moist (watering every 7-14 days), and reduce watering in the winter. Water whenever leaves begin to flatten, or when the first 1/2 inch of soil is dry. Warning Be sure not to overwater your string of pearls—overwatering can lead to soggy roots, causing root rot and making your only recourse of action to propagate and discard the main plant. Temperature and Humidity String of pearls plants thrive in warm temperatures above 70ºF from spring through fall, and it grows best with winter temperatures, ranging from 50-60ºF. This plant prefers low humidity, so avoid placing it in any already-humid areas of your home, like a kitchen or bathroom. Fertilizer Feed your string of pearls plants biweekly during the growing season with a balanced liquid or water-soluble fertilizer diluted to about half strength. During its dormant winter period, only feed the plant every six weeks. Types of String of Pearls Plant multiple string of pearls succulents Credit: The Spruce / Kara Riley There are several closely related plants to String of pearls that feature differently shaped leaves, looking more like bananas, teardrops, or watermelons with stripes. These close cousins in the same daisy family include: Curio radicans: Fuller and not as trailing as string of pearls, this varietal has tendrils with banana-shaped leaves; commonly called string of bananas or string of fish hooks. Curio herreanus: Commonly called string of watermelon or string of beads, this trailing plant has tiny melon-shaped leaves with purple striping. Curio citriformus: This varietal has both erect and trailing stems filled with plump, teardrop leaves and small white flowers that bloom between late summer and winter. Pruning Using sterilized scissors or pruners, trim off any dead stems and pearls, as well as any stems that have lost a lot of their leaves. If your plant is getting leggy or too long, trim those branches and propagate new plants from the cuttings. Pruning will promote fuller, bushier plants.

Propagating String of Pearls Plant String of pearl plants are easily propagated in soil, on soil, or from stem cuttings. To keep your plant alive for years, you'll want to take cuttings and make new plants. Spring, summer, or early fall (in warmer climates) are good times to propagate string of pearls plant. It takes three to four weeks for the plant to take root. Propagation from seeds is less successful. Here's how to grow plants from cuttings: Gather supplies. To propagate string of pearls plant, you will need sterilized pruning snips or scissors, a four- or six-inch pot, and cactus or succulent soil. Trim cuttings. Cut several four- to five-inch stems just below a leaf node. Remove the last two leaves. Lay out the stems for about one to two days before planting. The cut ends and areas where the leaves were removed need to callus over and get dry. Prepare the containers. Fill a pot with soil. In the center, make a hole where you will plant the stems. Plant cuttings. Place the cut ends into the hole at least an inch deep. All leaves should be above the soil. Pack the dirt around the stems. Wait a few days before watering thoroughly. Care for the plant. If indoors, place it in a bright spot. Outdoors, the plant does better in partial sun. Water the soil when it dries up. Potting and Repotting String of Pearls Plant The ideal time to repot your string of pearls plant is at the beginning of spring. Get a well-draining pot with ample drainage holes. Terracotta and unglazed ceramic pots are ideal for succulents. The pot should be the next size up from the pot you currently have, usually two to three inches larger and deeper. Use a fast-draining succulent or cactus soil mix. Add the soil to the bottom of the pot, gently remove the root ball from the old pot and center it on the bed of fresh soil. Fill the soil around the root ball up to one inch below the lip of the pot. You can repot these plants annually, but only a few times before they eventually begin to die back. After a few years, it's better to propagate a plant from new cuttings rather than trying to preserve and replant an older plant. Overwintering If you live in zone 8 or below, bring your string of pearls plant indoors during the winter; it will not survive a freezing winter outdoors. If you want your plant to eventually bloom, give it a cool-down period with temperatures just above freezing between 35-44ºF. Keep the plant in a non-heated room that gets at least six hours of light, providing it the cool period it needs. Water very rarely—about once per month during the dormant period. Common Pests Aphids, mites, whiteflies, gnats, mealybugs, and ants are common bugs attracted to string of pearls. Insects often overtake it if the plant is unhealthy. Poor drainage, high humidity, overcrowding, and insufficient light weaken the defenses of the plant. Avoid overwatering, mist the plant with neem oil solution, move the plant to a well-ventilated area, and inspect your plants regularly for pests. Neem oil and insecticidal soap are two organic pest control methods for insects on your plant. Try these methods before going the route of synthetic pesticides. Pests to Watch Look out for aphids which will look like tiny, pear-shaped insects that are light green, red, black, or yellow. To remove them, you can spray insecticidal soap or treat the plant with neem oil. How to Get String of Pearls Plant to Bloom Overwintering is essential if you want to see your succulents bloom. String of pearls bloom in summer, producing one-half-inch daisy-like white flowers with long red stamens and bright yellow anthers. The small flowers are not showy, but are fragrant with a sweet and spicy, cinnamon-like scent. Give the plant a cool-down period, leaving it relatively dry in the winter months. Once the growing season begins in spring, fertilize twice a week. Although it rarely flowers when kept indoors, it may bloom if it's fed regularly and has sufficient water and light. A bright windowsill with several hours of direct sun is adequate. When it flowers, its blooms last a month or so. Common Problems With String of Pearls Plant String of pearls plants rarely have issues with pests and diseases, making them great to keep. The biggest problem this plant has is usually related to too much or not enough water. Always Disinfect Pruners Plants highly sensitive to bacteria that are transmitted to the plant via pruning tools, pots, and potting medium. Make sure to disinfect your pruning shears and containers, and only purchase potting medium from a reputable source. Shriveling Leaves Wilting or withering leaves are usually a sign of underwatering or overwatering. If you've frequently been watering and the soil feels soggy, you are watering too much, or the plant needs better drainage. Water once every seven to 14 days; the top inch of soil should feel dry before watering again. If the round leaves flatten, it's a sign you should increase water frequency. Yellowing or Graying Leaves Yellowing or gray-colored leaves are often caused by insect activity. Regularly treating the plant with neem oil should keep insects at bay. Mushy Stems and Leaves Turning Purple If your string of pearls has mushy stems or leaves, it has probably been overwatered. Let the plant dry out. If it recovers, begin watering on a regular schedule; if it continues to struggle, remove any healthy stems and propagate them in a separate pot with clean soil. Sterilize the pot before using it again.

When I moved to Santa Barbara, quite a few pots had been left behind at my new home by the previous owner. I zoomed in on one of them for a String of Pearls. Fortunately, they’re easy to find here. Four years ago I bought a 2″ plant and in it went into the large pot on the patio outside my dining room planted along with the Coprosma, Plectranthus, and whatever seasonal annuals catch my fancy. It grew fairly fast and tends to trail rather than spread so I figured it was time for a little propagation. strings of the string of pearl plant on top of a grey rustic background Posts With More Details About Growing A String Of Pearls Plant (newer to older) Answering Your Questions About String Of Pearls Repotting A String Of Pearls Plant Growing String Of Pearls Plants Indoors: 10 Common Problems You May Have Propagating A String Of Pearls Plant String Of Pearls Plant Flowers Growing A String Of Pearls Plant Outdoors String Of Pearls Houseplant Care Rejuvenating My String Of Pearls Plant Propagating A String Of Pearls As evident in the picture above, I’ve been cutting them off when they hit the ground. They trail down about 3′. Where they’ve been cut, a split or 2 occurs. From there, they keep on growing from there. This would usually trigger any other plant to spread but with this one, it just keeps growing lengthwise and not widthwise. So it was time to pull out my floral nips (their long pointed blades are great for taking cuttings) and get busy. I cut off a few of those long, slender stems and stripped the top round leaves (aka “the pearls) off so I could stick those stems right back into the pot. I make sure at least 3 or 4 leaf nodes are down into the soil – that’s where the roots emerge from. This pot is filled with good organic potting soil and regularly top-dressed with both compost and worm compost so no soil prep is necessary here. I have lots of succulents in my yard which I normally heal off. But, with these stems being so minuscule in diameter, I skip that step and directly plant them back in. Read about my worm compost/compost feeding right here. How to Care for String of Pearls (outdoors) The light exposure is bright but not direct – the Coprosma shades it from any direct afternoon sunlight. Soil that is well-drained, such as potting soil or cactus mix, is very important because they like to completely dry out between waterings. Those round little pearls store water in them. Like any succulent, what I am going to tell you next is important to its survival: Do not overwater this plant. I can selectively and routinely water the Coprosma, Plectranthus, and annuals. This gives the String of Pearls a drink when I feel it needs it. As for insects and diseases, mine stays free and clear. So, there’s no personal advice I can give on that. By the way, they do flower but the small white, fuzzy blooms are pretty insignificant when it comes to size. But boy, they are sweetly scented! This plant is popular because it’s unusual and a conversion piece, not for a showy flower display."

However, providing these plants with the correct amount of moisture can be tricky as, if overwatered, string of pearls can sulk and the roots may begin to rot. String of pearls close up. The string of pearls plant is easy to grow and care for. [Photo: MariaNikiforova/Shutterstock.com] Discover more succulent houseplant Succulent plant Houseplant Water Houseplants houseplants plant succulents Plantura String of pearls (Senecio rowleyanus), or string of peas or string of beads as they are also known, are relatively easy-care plants. As long as you meet their growing conditions, they are not too high maintenance. Once this succulent is in a suitable location, it requires little water and nutrients. Read on to learn more about repotting and watering string of pearls and what to do when your string of pearls is drying up. Contents Watering string of pearls Less is more when it comes to how often to water string of pearls. As these plants originate from South Africa, they are accustomed to minimal rainfall and dry soil. And just like other succulents, string of pearls store water in their foliage. Hence, they are more drought-tolerant than most other houseplants and can easily go 2 to 3 weeks without being watered. They are far more likely to struggle if overwatered. When it comes to watering string of pearls, wait until the top 2 to 3cm of soil is dry to the touch. Use room temperature rain water if possible, but soft, room temperature tap water is fine too. If growing string of pearls in a shallow pot, you can water from the base by placing the pot in a bowl of water for a few minutes or until the soil is moist. After a few minutes, remove the pot and allow any excess water to drain away freely. When using a taller container with a thick drainage layer of rocks at the bottom, watering from above is best to ensure the soil can access the water. During the growing season, this succulent only needs watering once every 10 to 14 days, depending on the conditions. In winter, reduce watering down to about once a month. Close up of string of pearls plant String of pearls plants are highly sensitive to overwatering [Photo: itscaramel/Shutterstock.com] Fertilising string of pearls Like any plant, string of pearls occasionally need nutrients to grow. However, as they are light-feeders, they rarely need fertilising. If you have just repotted your string of pearls and given it fresh soil, you will not need to feed it at all for another year. After that, fertilising about every 8 weeks during the growing season should suffice. There are special cactus and succulent fertilisers available that meet string of pearls’ nutrient requirements. Refrain from fertilising this plant in the winter. String of pearls in hanging pot Refrain from fertilising too much to keep your string of pearls’ foliage green and plump [Photo: Daydreamr Digital Studio/ Shutterstock.com] Which soil for string of pearls? String of pearls are light feeders and dislike heavy soil that is prone to waterlogging. For this reason, the best soil for string of pearls plants is a well-draining mix that is low in nutrients. A succulent or cactus compost is ideal. Alternatively, simply mix some sand or perlite into a low-nutrient and well-draining compost. Our peat-free Plantura Organic Herb & Seedling Compost is ideal for string of pearls as it is low in nutrients and well-draining, allowing air to circulate the roots. As these plants develop a rather shallow root system, they perform best when grown on a thin layer of soil with good underlying drainage.

Repotting string of pearls String of pearls need repotting either before they start to become root bound or every 2 to 3 years, whichever comes first. Signs that it is time to repot your string of pearls include the roots growing out of the bottom of the pot, the soil no longer holding moisture and the soil level dropping. It is also a good idea to repot string of pearls when any root rot has occurred or if it is infested with fungus gnats. Repotting string of pearls plant String of pearls plants require a well-draining soil [Photo: Violeta Carlos Fabuel/Shutterstock.com] Due to its shallow root system, we recommend repotting your string of pearls into a shallow pot or bowl. If using a taller pot, you will need to create a thicker drainage layer at the bottom. Terracotta or unglazed ceramic pots are ideal for growing string of pearls plants, as they are porous and absorb water, so help prevent waterlogging. Plastic pots are fine too, but may require a more well-draining soil mix to help increase airflow to the roots and allow water to drain away. Whichever pot you choose, ensure it has drainage holes and create a drainage layer of rocks or gravel to further aid drainage. Then, fill it about one third of the way with a suitable growing medium. Gently remove some of the old soil from the roots and place the plant into the new pot at roughly the same depth it was previously planted at. Next, fill any gaps around the plant with soil, gently pressing down as you go. Be careful not to plant your string of pearls too deeply as these plants prefer to be grown nearer the top of the soil. Finally, water your plant and allow any excess moisture to drain off. Tip: string of pearls are frost-tender succulents and will struggle in temperatures below 10 °C. That said, if you want to encourage your string of pearls to flower in spring, keep it somewhere at temperatures of around 13°C to 15 °C over the winter months. Why is my string of pearls dying? Sometimes a string of pearls may start to look like it is drying up, shrivelled and unhappy. The natural response may be to assume it needs more water, yet the opposite may actually be true. Hanging string of pearls plant String of pearls can be placed outdoors during the summer months, but need to be brought back indoors to overwinter [Photo: Jessica Ruscello/Shutterstock.com] Here are some of the most common string of pearls care mistakes and how to remedy them: Overwatering: watering too frequently or not allowing excess water to drain away can result in the soil becoming waterlogged. This can cause the plant’s roots to rot, which in turn leads to the foliage flattening, wilting or turning mushy. If the plant has been overwatered, either leave the plant to dry out or repot it, cutting away the dead roots in the process. If your plant looks too far gone, then it may be worth taking some string of pearls cuttings from any healthy-looking stems to propagate replacement plants with. Underwatering: too little water may also cause the plant’s foliage to dry out and shrivel up. However, being fairly drought-tolerant, this is less likely than being overwatered. If you suspect you have underwatered, give the plant a good soak until all the soil is moist, before letting the excess water drain away. Too much direct sunlight: while string of pearls need at least 6 hours of indirect light a day, they do not like direct sunlight, especially from the midday sun. If it receives strong direct light, brown spots may begin to appear on the foliage until eventually the whole leaves turn brown. If this is the case, reposition the plant to somewhere better suited to your string of pearls’ light requirements. This may mean moving it somewhere with more diffused light or away from a window where the leaves may get scorched.

Commonly called zebra plant, inch plant, silver inch plant or more recently, wandering dude, Tradescantia zebrina (=T. pendula; Zebrina pendula) is a popular houseplant in the spiderwort family (Commelinaceae) grown for its variegated foliage. The similar looking, but more robust, all green T. fluminensis) lacks the attractive striped purplish-green leaves of the zebra plant. This is the plant for the wanna-be-green-thumb! It is very tough and will thrive in almost any conditions indoors. This tender perennial native to southern Mexico and Guatemala can be grown outdoors in mild climates (zones 9-11) where it does not freeze or as an annual where winters are cold. Tradescantia zebrina makes a good temporary groundcover (it is not hardy in the Midwest), here mixed with toad lily (Tricyrtis). Tradescantia zebrina makes a good temporary groundcover (it is not hardy in the Midwest), here mixed with toad lily (Tricyrtis). This creeping plant makes a good groundcover 6-12” high. It has succulent stems with ovate to lanceolate leaves clasping the stem. The upper leaf surface is green to purple with two wide, silvery-white stripes, while the lower leaf surface is a uniform deep magenta. If you look closely you can see the fine hairs along the leaf margins and may note that the surfaces seem to sparkle in bright light. Color intensity is greatest in full sun in our area but in more southern locations too much sun will cause the colors to wash out. In low light conditions, stems lose lower leaves and the leaves lose much of their coloring. The stems will branch or root at the nodes and ascend at the flowering tips. The stems break easily at the nodes. The watery, mucilaginous sap can cause skin inflammation in susceptible individuals. The foliage ranges in color from green to purple depending on light exposure. The foliage ranges in color from green to purple depending on light exposure. The inconspicuous flowers arise in the leaf axils. The inconspicuous flowers arise in the leaf axils. The inconspicuous boat-shaped flowers are white to lavender. Like other tradescantia flowers, they have 3 petals and prominent yellow anthers. Plants may bloom sporadically throughout the year, although they rarely appear on indoor plants. This plant does best in light shade outdoors but bright light indoors. It can be moved outdoors after all danger of frost has passed but be sure to acclimate it gradually to brighter conditions to prevent sunburn. Provide regular water. This plant does well if the soil is allowed to dry out between waterings. It tolerates heavy pruning and pinching the plants will promote denser foliage. Any leggy growth can be pruned off as cuttings for propagation. T. zebrina is a good trailing plant for containers. T. zebrina is a good trailing plant for containers. T. zebrina makes a good trailing plant for seasonal containers or an underplanting with larger houseplants, such as a hibiscus standard, plumeria, or ficus tree. It can be used to fill in at the base of other tall tropicals such as cannas, bananas and elephant ears, either in containers or in the ground. Treat it like an annual and plant cuttings in the ground for the growing season once all danger of frost has passed. It is fast-growing, with trailing stems that can become straggly (especially in low light conditions), so you may want to renew containers by adding tip cuttings back in the top periodically. Many people acquire this plant from friends or plant sales as each segment is capable of producing a new plant. T. zebrina is easily started from cuttings which root readily in water or moist soil. It can also be layered, as roots form at the nodes when in contact with moist soil. A few cultivars, such as ‘Purpusii’,‘Tricolor’ or ‘Quadricolor’, are sometimes mentioned, but they don’t seem to differ significantly from the species. – Susan Mahr, University of Wisconsin – Madison"

Here you will find the most important information about inch plant care and location. Wandering jew plant The foliage of spiderwort is usually tricoloured [Photo: Phatthanun Kaewsuwan/ Shutterstock.com] The long shoots of the inch plant (Tradescantia zebrina) look best trailing from a hanging basket. In this article you will learn, among other things, how to help this popular houseplant to grow bushy and everything you need to know about its care. Contents Tradescantia zebrina: flower, origin, and characteristics Native to Central and South America, Tradescantia zebrina belongs to the Commelinaceae family. There is some disagreement about what genus it belongs to: sometimes it is classified as a member of the spiderwort genus (Tradescantia), but sometimes it is considered a separate genus, Zebrina pendula. This spiderwort is also known as the violet inch plant or the wandering Jew plant. Alongside its decorative leaves, the inch plant in nature develops pink flowers all year round which are located individually in the leaf axils (the points on the plant where leaf stalks branch out from the main stem). Tradescantia can also flower as a houseplant, provided it gets enough light. As a succulent-stemmed plant, the inch plant can store a little water in its leaves and shoots. Wandering jew plant with pink flowers The flowers of Tradescantia zebrina are pink and have three petals [Photo: Grisha Bruev/ Shutterstock.com] The most beautiful varieties As well as the classic inch plant, there are also several other varieties of Tradescantia zebrina that differ mainly in their colouring. Here is a brief look at the most beautiful Tradescantia varieties: Tradescantia zebrina ‘Quadricolor’ has pink rather than purple leaves, which make a beautiful pattern together with the green and white stripes. Tradescantia zebrina ‘Purpusii’ has particularly vivid purple leaves that stand out next to the other, mostly green houseplants. Tradescantia zebrina ‘Discolor’ also boasts leaves with different coloured stripes in pink, green, and silver. Pink and purple leaves of wandering jew Some varieties of Tradescantia appear more pink than purple [Photo: Amverlly/ Shutterstock.com] Planting Tradescantia zebrina: when, where, and how The Tradescantia zebrina plant is straightforward when it comes to care and location. Place the inch plant in a bright spot that is protected from the midday sun. However, a little sun in the evening or morning is beneficial. During the growth period, keep the plant at normal room temperature, so between 20 and 25°C. During this period, you can also keep Tradescantia zebrina outside on a balcony or in the garden. Here, again, place the plant in a sheltered location, without full sun. In winter you can keep the inch plant in slightly cooler temperatures, between 12 to 15°C is sufficient. Tip: If Tradescantia zebrina gets enough light, with a bit of luck you will be able to enjoy its beautiful flowers. The inch plant does not need any special soil; a versatile all-purpose potting soil is absolutely fine. A particularly sustainable choice is, for example, our Plantura Organic All Purpose Compost: Its clay minerals ensure the soil has a good water storage capacity, so that the plant has a continuous supply of water. Furthermore, the slightly acidic pH value is ideal for Tradescantia zebrina. Wandering Jew plant outside in summer In summer, Tradescantia zebrina also feels at home outside [Photo: simona pavan/ Shutterstock.com] When using cuttings to plant Tradescantia zebrina, you can place several cuttings directly in one pot. Depending on the size of the pot, 10 to 15 cuttings will fit next to each other and make the inch plant look bushier. Tip: A hanging basket is an excellent way to display the inch plant’s trailing shoots. Place the pot in a bright location, for example in front of an east-facing window. Tradescantia zebrina care It does not take a lot of care to grow a healthy inch plant. Like almost all tropical plants, it only needs water every so often and occasional applications of fertiliser. Regular pruning can also help shape the plant’s growth. Wandering jew plant shoots By cutting back the shoots, the inch plant grows bushier [Photo: Winlyrung/ Shutterstock.com] Watering, fertilising, and pruning Tradescantia zebrina Water the inch plant regularly and make sure that the root ball is always moist. You may allow the soil to dry out on the surface every so often, but then water again. Lime-free water is best. Young plants need a little more water, so always keep their soil evenly moist. Avoid waterlogging by draining excess water from the pot a few minutes after watering. During the growth phase, the inch plant needs fertiliser occasionally to ensure a good supply of essential nutrients. A classic green plant fertiliser works for this, such as our Plantura Liquid Houseplant Food. This encourages lush foliage and healthy growth so that Tradescantia zebrina can develop long shoots. The microorganisms in our fertiliser also stimulate root growth.

As the shoots of Tradescantia zebrina usually grow quick and long during the growing season, you may need to cut the plant back. On top of this, leaves on the ends of the shoots often dry out and are shed. Cut the shoots back generously in spring, to promote branching and bushier growth. Tip: To help recreate tropical conditions, you can spray the inch plant with a water sprayer now and again. Wandering jew plant in hanging basket Tradescantia zebrina looks beautiful in a hanging basket [Photo: Viktoria Hans/ Shutterstock.com] Transplanting You can repot the inch plant during the growing season, so between spring and autumn. If the old pot is completely rooted, it is time for a larger planter. Otherwise, transplanting every two to three years will suffice. Propagating Tradescantia zebrina The easiest way to propagate Tradescantia zebrina is from cuttings. In spring, simply cut a few shoots from the mother plant: These should already have some leaves. Then place the cuttings in a glass of water in a bright place. After a few days, roots should have formed, and you can plant the cuttings in a pot. As older shoots lose their leaves and become bare, we do not recommend using Tradescantia zebrina offshoots for propagation. The cutting method always produces new young shoots with plenty of leaves and shortens the bare shoots. Tradescantia cuttings in water Inch plants are best propagated from cuttings [Photo: Elena Loginova/ Shutterstock.com] Overwintering: is Tradescantia zebrina hardy? In winter, Tradescantia zebrina can tolerate cooler temperatures, but keep this above 10°C. Place the plant in a bright spot so that the leaves retain their vibrant colour. If the plant experiences freezing temperatures, shoots and stems may die of frost. Is Tradescantia zebrina poisonous? Inch plants are not poisonous to humans or animals, so you do not need to worry about placing it in your home. There are many other spiderwort plants whose flowers also grow in our latitudes. Here you can find out everything about this beautiful plant genus."

Asparagus Ming Fern About the Asparagus Fern Asparagus ferns are an easy to care for evergreen houseplant with feathery, fern-like, clumping leaves. Some of the most common types of Asparagus ferns are: foxtail, plumosa, ming and sprengeri. Despite their name, asparagus ferns are not actually ferns but instead perennial plants in the family Asparagaceae. They were named fern for their appearance but ferns reproduce via spores while Asparagaceae reproduce via seeds. I keep my Asparagus ferns in my bathroom for its high humidity. A couple of them hang in my shower which is perfect because they make ideal hanging plants and it keeps them out of reach of my cats. Asparagus ferns have few requirements to make them healthy, happy and growing. A loose, airy potting mixture is essential with bright to medium indirect light. Keep humidity high and water when the soil dries out, which can happen faster than with your average plant, and you will have a fast growing fern. If you want to plant these outside their USDA zones are 9 to 11 however they can become invasive so its recommended you plant these in a container as opposed to the ground. Pot them in a sunny morning spot that turns to partial shade in the afternoon. Varieties of Asparagus Fern Asparagus ferns come in a few varieties but here are the 4 most common ones: Foxtail Fern (Asparagus densiflorus) - These are aptly named as their plumes resemble a bushy fox’s tail. Their leaves are light green, needle-like and look light and airy. They have tiny white flowers which turn into red berries. This variety gets quite large, over 2 feet tall and up to 4 feet wide. Sprengeri Fern (Asparagus densiflorus) - Sprengeri’s leaves are very dense, emerald green needles that look like a fern with a bad hair day. They too will get white blooms that turn into red berries and will reach about 3 feet in size. Plumosa Fern (Asparagus setaceus) - When someone says Asparagus fern this variety is what comes to mind. Most do not call it Plumosa but just call it the Asparagus fern. They have dark green, feathery leaves and look the most like ferns to me of this bunch. Everything about them makes you want to run your hands over their leaves as they are just so soft and delicate. Their new growth stretches straight up into the air and before they unfurl, look just like asparagus. The new growth then flattens out almost like awnings over the old growth. Their blooms are greenish-white and their berries turn black. Ming Fern (Asparagus retrofractus) - Ming ferns are like a mix of a foxtail and sprengeri and sometimes can be hard to differentiate since they are less common. Their leaves resemble clumps of pom poms and you will also hear it referred to as a pom pom fern. This plant is an edible vegetable and can get around 6 feet large. Ming fern’s branches grow in a zig zag pattern and although it appears super soft like the other Asparagus ferns, it has spikes on its stems. View fullsizeFoxtail Fern with Berries Foxtail Fern with Berries View fullsizeSprengeri Fern Sprengeri Fern How to Care for your Asparagus Fern SOIL: The key to success of an Asparagus fern is a fast draining soil. There are a couple ways to do this: Mix 1 part potting soil with one part perlite. While potting soil generally has perlite in it, we want to add more to increase aeration and improve drainage. Asparagus ferns also like a loamy soil. You can make this by mixing 20% clay, 40% sand and 40% silt. LIGHT: Asparagus ferns like bright indirect light. Too much hot sun and you can scorch their leaves, too little and it will yellow and drop needles. You can take 2 approaches when placing your asparagus ferns: Place directly in an east facing window. It will love that soft morning sun. A north window MAY be enough light but just keep an eye on it and if it’s looking sad, move it too a brighter locale. Place it to the side of or a few feet back from a south or west facing window. This is where indirect becomes important. These windows will get afternoon and evening sun which is very hot, especially in summer, and it can burn your plant. HUMIDITY: Keep the humidity high! I have mine placed in my bathroom to make sure this need is met. If you cannot do that then buy a humidifier (this is mine), mist it daily, place it near other plants as that increases general humidity, or place the plant on a tray of pebbles and water. WATER: Asparagus ferns like a very deep watering followed by letting them dry out. Check the top 2” of soil by sticking your finger in. If it is dry, water deeply so that water flows out the bottom into its saucer. Dump the water and place the saucer back under the plant. View fullsizePlumosa Fern Plumosa Fern View fullsizePlumosa Fern Plumosa Fern Common Questions PROPAGATION: Asparagus ferns have roots called tubers which are very thick and fleshy. This makes them easier to divide. When deciding to propagate make sure there are enough stems for each section (2-4) and enough thick tubers for each section with plenty of offshoots. Use your hands or pruning shears to gently divide the fern and repot each in fresh soil and water. YELLOWING/DROPPING NEEDLES: This is one of the most common issues. Dropping needles can come from intense temperature changes so make sure your fern isn’t getting any drafts. Yellowing can come from too little light or overwatering. Check out the section above where we cover light and watering. REPOTTING: Asparagus ferns grow pretty fast and need to be repotted once a year (check out this guide to repotting). Because their roots are thick tubers it can become quite obvious when you need to repot. The roots may start poking out the bottom of the pot or they may push the plant up and out of the pot. Another sign is that your water runs right through your plant and doesn’t seem to be getting absorbed. This means your pot is mostly root as compared to soil. PESTS & DISEASES: Luckily these are not prone to pests and diseases. The two most likely are scale and mealy bugs. these can be treated with an insecticidal soap or, my favorite, neem oil. PETS: All the varieties of Asparagus fern are toxic and cause lead to itchiness and throwing up. A lot of toxic plants my cats just ignore, but these are not one those, hence why they are hanging in my shower.

    "content": "How to Grow and Care for Asparagus Fern Asparagus fern (Asparagus densiflorus), also known as foxtail fern, is a member of the Asparagaceae family. It is an easy-to-grow, popular houseplant recognizable by its bright green, feathery-textured foliage. In zones 9 to 11, these plants are hardy outdoors, growing as creeping spreading plants, but it is also common for them to be grown as indoor houseplants.. When asparagus fern is content in its location, it can produce small flowers followed by berries that are mildly toxic to cats and dogs.12 Warning Asparagus fern can spread rapidly when planted outdoors—to the point of serious invasiveness. Check with your local extension agent to determine if it's invasive in your area. an asparagus fern in a basket Credit: The Spruce / Leticia Almeida Common Name Asparagus fern, foxtail fern Botanical Name Asparagus aethiopicus, A. densiflorus Family Asparagaceae Plant Type Perennial Mature Size 3 ft. tall, 4 ft. wide Sun Exposure Partial Soil Type Well-drained Soil pH Acidic, neutral Bloom Time Spring, summer, fall Flower Color White Hardiness Zones 9-11 (USDA) Native Area South Africa Toxicity Toxic to humans, toxic to pets3 4 Asparagus Fern Care Here are the main requirements for growing asparagus fern: Plant in partial shade in organically rich, moist, well-draining soil. Grows well in warm, humid climates, but water enough to keep the soil moist. Fertilize with a liquid or water-soluble all-purpose plant food. Prefers temperatures of a high of 70°F and low of 55°F. Warning Asparagus fern is considered an invasive species when planted outdoors in Florida, Texas, and Hawaii. closeup of an asparagus fern Credit: The Spruce / Leticia Almeida closeup of an asparagus fern closeup of an asparagus fern Asparagus setaceus Asparagus sprengeri Light The asparagus fern thrives in dappled shade, although it can be acclimated to more light. Keep it out of direct, bright sunlight, which may scorch the foliage. Soil Plant asparagus ferns in pots or containers in moist, loose, well-drained potting soil. If you're planting your asparagus fern outdoors, plant it in rich, well-drained soil that is slightly acidic (pH 6.5-6.8). It prefers rich soil to thrive, and also make sure the chosen containers have drainage holes. Water Asparagus fern grows well in humidity, so warmer, humid air and daily misting will help it thrive. Outdoors, keep the plant well-watered and the soil moist to prevent it from completely drying out (You can gauge dryness by the top inch of soil.) If you're growing your plant indoors and have dry conditions, especially during the winter heating season, aim to mist the plant daily, focusing on the arching stems. Temperature and Humidity Try to maintain a warm temperature around 70°F and not dip below 55°F for too long. If you have a shady porch or a greenhouse, the indoor plants will likely respond with abundant growth over the summer. Avoid sudden changes in temperatures, which can cause the cladodes to drop. High Humidity Asparagus ferns thrive in high humidity because they're native to tropical regions. You can easily place it in a bathroom since the steam will be beneficial for its growth. When there is a lack of humidity, you may notice leaf drop or brown tips. Fertilizer Feed asparagus fern with liquid or water-soluble all-purpose plant food diluted to half strength. In the spring, fertilize the plant monthly. During the summer, container plants may need weekly feedings; otherwise, feed monthly. Types of Asparagus Fern There are several popular cultivars of asparagus fern, including: 'Myeri,' which is also known as foxtail fern, has dense foliage on upright stems. 'Sprengeri,' which is also referred to as an asparagus emerald fern, boasts long stems and a full, almost fluffy, mounding form. 'Sprengeri Compacta' has the same features as its namesake but is a dwarf variety. 'Nana' features bright green foliage and is another compact variety of fern. 'Foxtail Fern' boasts luscious, fluffy stems of pine needle-like leaves, which gives it a plush appearance and is popular in flower arrangements. Is This the Right Plant for You? AN ASPARAGUS FERN IS A GOOD CHOICE FOR YOU IF: You want an easy-to-care-for houseplant. You want a houseplant that that can survive lower light conditions. You don't have pets, or have a safe place out of pets' reach indoors. Pruning Asparagus fern is a fast grower (adding 2 inches of growth per day), so it is crucial to cut at the base of the plant and not in the middle of a stem when pruning. Do not cut more than 1/3 of the plant at a time. Use clean garden shears or sharp scissors to remove brown portions or to regenerate an older plant. Asparagus fern's “leaves” are leaf-like cladodes. The true leaves are barely visible scales near the base of the cladodes. Wear Gloves While the ferns look soft to the touch, they're quite sharp. Wear gardening gloves if you plan to prune an older plant. Propagating Asparagus Fern The easiest way to propagate asparagus fern is by digging up and dividing the tuberous roots: Dig up the plant. In spring, dig up the entire plant (or remove it from its pot), using a trowel or shovel. Make sure to wear gloves to protect yourself from the sharp spikes. Divide the root clump into sections. Using a trowel or knife, make sure each section includes a root section, as well as a portion of the crown with growing shoots. Replant the pieces. Using individual pots, replant the plant pieces in their own garden locations. It is best to keep the plant shaded until new growth begins. How to Grow Asparagus Fern From Seed Asparagus fern seeds can be found inside the small red berries produced by mature plants. When the berries are fully ripe, mash them and strain out the small seeds. There are typically one to three seeds per berry. Before planting, scarify and soak seeds overnight. Then, press them on top of the soil since they need enough light to germinate. Germination will take a few weeks. When true leaves have developed, you can transplant the seedlings into larger pots to continue growing. Potting and Repotting Asparagus Fern Plant asparagus ferns in pots or containers in loose, well-drained potting soil. Asparagus ferns grow quickly, and the tuberous roots can easily break a pot. Plan on repotting often. When it comes to repotting, divide the plant into big clumps, and be sure to take multiple underground roots when dividing. Place the divided plants into new pots filled with fresh potting soil and water well.

Keep them in bright light, away from drafts and radiators. Make sure to keep the soil moist, but do not let the roots stand in water, as this can cause root rot. Outdoor Care for Asparagus Fern If you live in a warmer climate, you can keep your asparagus fern outdoors in an area that will get partial shade. Too much direct sun can scorch or change the color of the leaves. Common Pests & Plant Diseases Spider mites, aphids, whiteflies, and mealybugs like to hang out in this plant's leaves; get rid of them with insecticidal soap.2 Overly wet conditions can cause root rot. Avoid overwatering to prevent these issues.2 Pest to Watch If you suspect spider mites on your plant, look for fine white webbing, stippled and yellowed leaves, and white dots. Common Problems With Asparagus Fern While relatively easy to grow, asparagus fern does have a couple of issues that are easily remedied if you know what you're looking for: Yellow Leaves Asparagus fern's leaves will turn yellow if the plant has pests—like spider mites or mealybugs—or if your plant isn't getting enough sunlight.2 This plant's leaves may also turn yellow if it's over-fertilized (the solution is to fertilize less often), or if it has too much or too little light. Brown Leaves If your asparagus fern is turning brown and looks like it's drying out, it could be that you have under-watered it. Cut off the brown, dried sections, and try watering more often. Dropping Leaves One of the biggest nuisances with asparagus fern is dropping foliage, which can litter floors and tables with fine dried-out needles. This normally happens because of inconsistent watering, and although these plants don't like to soak in water, it's important not to dry them out. More frequent watering and misting are usually the solution to a plant that is badly shedding. FAQ Where is the best place to grow an asparagus fern? Asparagus fern can be grown both indoors and outdoors. In the house, an east-facing window in a humid environment (kitchen or bathroom) is ideal, and make sure to protect it from cold drafts. If you regularly repot and care for an asparagus fern, it can have an indefinite life as a houseplant. However, if it's not regularly divided and repotted, it may perish within a few years as it becomes root-bound and overgrown. Can asparagus ferns grow outdoors? Yes, in hardiness zones 9 or warmer, you can grow asparagus fern outdoors as a perennial. Outdoor garden plants have an easier time of it, as they will simply spread to fill available space. Does the asparagus fern come back every year? Yes, asparagus fern will come back every year since it's a perennial plant. If you live in the climates (USDA Zones 9-11), you can leave the plant outdoors year-round. How do you keep asparagus fern plants bushy? To keep your asparagus fern bushy, make sure it's getting adequate sunlight. If your plant starts to look leggy, you can pinch back some of the stems just at the ends to encourage bushier growth. Is asparagus fern pet-friendly? No, asparagus fern is toxic to both cats and dogs since it can irritate their skin and digestive systems"

    "content": "Asparagus fern, Asparagus densiflorus Share: Asparagus fern is a sprawling shrub native to coastal southeastern South Africa. Despite the common name, it is not a true fern, but is in the asparagus family (Asparagaceae) or the lily family (Liliaceae, which includes plants such as amaryllis, daylilies, hosta, and tulips) depending on the classification system used. It is in the genus Asparagus, which includes the edible A. officinalis, along with about 300 other species. The exact classification of this species is a bit confused, with most references to Asparagus densiflorus, but the names A. aethiopicus, A. sprengeri, and Protasparagus densiflorus are also used as well by some. Meyeri asparagus fern in a container ‘Meyeri’ asparagus fern in a container This tender evergreen perennial with bright green, ferny foliage is commonly used as an outdoor ornamental plant or houseplant. In mild climates, it is planted outdoors as a groundcover or in containers. It is hardy in zones 9-11 but the roots will often survive to zone 7 if protected. In more temperate climates, it is used as a seasonal annual or container plant. In its native habitat, asparagus fern is found in shady, sandy sites, including coastal dunes, open rocky places and woods. Where it has escaped from cultivation, it is generally found along shady roadsides and invading woodlands or rainforests where it displaces native vegetation and prevents native species from reestablishing. It is considered an invasive weed in some locations, including Florida, Texas and Hawaii in the US. Asparagus fern produces long, upright or trailing, branching stems sparsely covered with sharp, stiff spines in the axils. The rounded stems, up to 6 feet long, are green to brown in color and have a shallow indentation along their length. What appear to be leaves are actually leaf-like cladodes (short, flattened stems that look and function like leaves). These needle-like “leaves” arise in groups of four to eight from the nodes along the stem. The true leaves are barely visible scales near the base of the cladodes. Plants have a dense fibrous root system as well as creeping rhizomes and numerous fleshy white bulbous tubers. The trailing stems (L) have groups of leaf-like cladodes (LC) that arise from the longitudinally ridged stems (RC). Sharp spines (RT) and the true leaves are barely visible at the base of the cladodes (RB, where arrow is pointing). The trailing stems (L) have groups of leaf-like cladodes (LC) that arise from the longitudinally ridged stems (RC). Sharp spines (RT) and the true leaves are barely visible at the base of the cladodes (RB, where arrow is pointing). Small white or pinkish-white flowers are produced in elongated clusters (racemes) along the stems from spring through fall on mature plants with sufficient light. Each flower has six tepals (3 petals and 3 sepals similar in appearance). Although fragrant, they are small enough not to be very noticeable – and plants grown in temperate climates often do not bloom. Plants are dioecious. If pollinated, female flowers are followed by small round berries up to ¼ inch in diameter. The green fruits mature to a glossy red and each contains one to three black seeds. Many birds are attracted to the fruits and are responsible for unintended seed dispersal in mild climates. The berries can cause dermatitis when in contact with skin and gastrointestinal upset if ingested and are toxic to cats and dogs. Small, pinkish-white flowers (L) are followed by red berries (C and R). Small, pinkish-white flowers (L) are followed by red berries (C and R). Plant asparagus fern in full sun or light shade; plants grown in full sun are more compact and dense than those grown in shade. It does best in moist soils rich in organic matter but tolerates almost any conditions and is fairly drought tolerant once established. Asparagus fern growing among red and magenta flowers Asparagus fern can be used as an annual foliage plant for textural contrast. Asparagus fern is valued as an ornamental for its bright green, arching stems and airy foliage. Its fine foliage gives a soft or fluffy appearance and can be used to good effect for textural contrast in combination with plants having medium or coarse-textured foliage or very large leaves. It can be planted in the ground with other annuals as a bedding plant after the last frost in cold climates. This plant makes a great filler plant in containers, especially in hanging baskets or large urns where the delicate foliage can cascade down. It has a tropical feel when combined with elephant ears, canna lilies and hibiscus. The foliage can also be incorporated as a filler with cut flowers in arrangements. Asparagus fern is a great houseplant for novice gardeners as it doesn’t require any special care. It grows well in direct or bright indirect light (the brighter the light, the faster it will grow) and because of the tuberous roots which store water, it can tolerate periods of neglect. It does best with consistent moisture, although plants should be kept drier in the winter and any fertilization stopped during that time. The foliage will yellow and drop if the soil is too dry or there isn’t enough light. Old or yellowed stems should be cut out at the base and the ends of stems can be trimmed back to keep the plant shaped. In the spring trim out old growth and begin fertilizing monthly for lush new growth. These plants can quickly outgrow their containers, so need frequent repotting to keep them growing vigorously. The roots are also quite strong and can break pots, so larger, thicker containers may be desireable. Repotting is best done in early spring before new growth starts. Indoor plants can be moved outdoors seasonally (bringing them back inside before frost) but should be acclimated to the stronger light outside before being moved to a spot in full sun. This plant has few pests, indoors or out, but occasionally become infested with aphids, mealybugs, spider mites or whiteflies. Asparagus fern can be propagated from seed and division. Seeds will germinate in 3-4 weeks at room temperature. Scarify the seeds and soak in water for a day before planting to hasten germination. Plants can be separated into smaller pieces or the tubers will regenerate plants. Spring is the best time for division but these tough plants can be propagated at almost any time of the year. The two most common varieties are ‘Sprengeri’ and ‘Meyeri’. The latter, commonly called foxtail asparagus fern, has more upright stems with denser foliage, resembling a fluffy animal’s tail, radiating outwards from the center of the plant. This cultivar is especially nice as an upright focal point in the ground or a container surrounded by lower plants. It does not produce seed as readily as the species so does not have the same invasive potential in mild climates. ‘Cwebe’ has graceful, upright, arching stems and copper-colored new growth. It does best in light shade. ‘Sprengeri Nanus’ and ’Sprengeri Compacta’ are more compact forms. – Susan Mahr, University of Wisconsin – Madison"

    "content": "How to Grow Peperomia Obtusifolia (Baby Rubber Plant) The baby rubber plant (Peperomia obtusifolia) is a compact, low-maintenance, tropical plant grown mostly for its glossy, spoon-shaped, fleshy, dark green or variegated foliage. It occasionally blooms nondescript, small, whitish-green flowers. Peperomia obtusifolia grows best in low-light or indirect bright light, in loose, moist soil, and thrives in high humidity. Learn how to grow and care for the adorable baby rubber plant and why pet-friendly Peperomia obtusifolia is considered one of the best houseplants for beginners. Common Name Baby rubber plant, pepper face plant Botanical Name Peperomia obtusifolia Family Piperaceae Plant Type Perennial, herbaceous Mature Size Up to 1 ft. tall Sun Exposure Partial Soil Type Clay, sand, loam Soil pH Acidic, neutral, alkaline Bloom Time Spring, summer, fall, winter Flower Color White Hardiness Zones 10-12 (USDA) Native Area South America Peperomia Obtusifolia Care Here are the basic care requirements for Peperomia obtusifolia: Choose an indoor spot for your baby rubber plant with bright but indirect light. Place a non-variegated baby rubber plant in low light. Avoid overwatering because baby rubber plants do not like soggy, wet conditions. Keep the plant in a humid room where the temperature remains between 65°F to 75°F. Fertilize monthly during the growing season. Peperomia Obtusifolia plant with round fleshy leaves in small clay pot Credit: The Spruce / Missy Schrott Peperomia Obtusifolia plant with round and waxy succulent-like leaves Peperomia Obtusifolia plant with round and shiny leaves closeup Light Keep your Peperomia obtusifolia out of prolonged, intense sunlight. The foliage can burn, and the unique coloration of a variegated cultivar may start to fade. A partially shady spot in a south, east, or west-facing window without too much direct afternoon sun usually works well for this plant. Non-variegated cultivars can handle low-light conditions, but some bright, early morning sun promotes growth and maximizes variegation. Soil Baby rubber plants thrive in moist conditions, but these epiphytic species dislike wet feet, which leads to root rot. Make certain the medium is well-draining. The plant isn't too fussy about soil but prefers a loose, fertile potting mix. A mix of 2 parts peat and 1 part perlite or sand will do the job. Water Moderate watering during the growing season (around every one to two weeks) is usually sufficient. Allow the potting mix to dry out on the top few inches before rewatering. Let the soil dry out more between waterings in the winter. However, while the leaves hold moisture and the plant has some drought tolerance, leaving a baby rubber plant too dry for long periods affects the growth and health of the foliage. Don't frequently leave your baby rubber plant dry for long periods, as this affects the foliage's growth and health. Temperature and Humidity Peperomia obtusifolia is the perfect plant for a bright, steamy bathroom. This plant thrives in temperatures from 65°F to 75°F—if the temperature in your home regularly dips below 50°F, this isn't the plant for you. Keep your baby rubber plant far from blasting heat, air conditioning units, and drafty windows. If you don't have your humidity-loving plant in a steamy bathroom, consider misting the leaves and using a pebble tray with water under the plant, especially during the active growth period in the summer. Fertilizer Peperomia obtusifolia have small, epiphytic roots and are not heavy feeders. However, a dose of diluted all-purpose liquid fertilizer once or twice a month during the growing season can help encourage healthy foliage growth. Types of Baby Rubber Plant Despite its common name, this epiphytic species is not related to the rubber plant (Ficus elastica) but is part of the large Peperomia genus. There are many baby rubber plant cultivars, including a wide selection of variegated options. Some popular options include: Peperomia obtusifolia ‘Alba’: These young plants have stems tinged with red and an attractive creamy white variegation that gradually fades to green as it matures. Peperomia obtusifolia ‘Gold Tip': The marbled variegation turns a gold shade towards the tip. Peperomia obtusifolia ‘Minima’: This particularly compact form grows small, dense green foliage. Pruning The plant has a bushy habit, and cutting back the foliage occasionally maintains a tidy shape. Pinching the tips of stems helps to encourage new, healthy foliage and avoids leggy growth. Removing dead and dying foliage directs energy to healthy, growing leaves and keeps your baby rubber plant looking its best. Tip If your baby rubber plant starts growing a long stem, it's perfectly fine to prune it away and use the cutting to propagate a new plant. Propagating Peperomia Obtusifolia Peperomia obtusifolia is easy to propagate with stem tip cuttings or division. Here's how to create a new plant from a stem cutting: Remove the top of a healthy stem (around 4 inches) with at least a couple of leaves on it, and one node (a bump where a new stem will emerge) below the leaves. Use a small pot (around 4 to 6 inches deep) with a soilless potting mix. Dip the base of the cutting in rooting hormone as an optional, extra step for successful growth. Keep one or two leaves on the cutting and embed the node into the potting mix. Moisten the potting mix without making it soggy and keep it at a warm temperature of at least 65°F. Place the cutting in a spot with bright light. Move the rooted cutting to a more appropriate permanent pot size when there's new growth. Potting and Repotting Peperomia Obtusifolia Baby rubber plants are not repotted often because this compact plant does not have an extensive root system. Once every few years is usually enough. If the roots are starting to grow out of the pot's drainage holes or the soil is lifting off the sides of the pot, the plant is likely outgrowing its current home. Repot in the spring before the main growing season. Choose a pot that's slightly larger than the original one, filled with fresh potting mix. A pot that's too big or deep contributes to too much water that needs to be absorbed from the soil, which can waterlog the plant. Tip A good rule of thumb is to repot a baby rubber plant in a pot that's only 2 inches larger than the original container. Common Problems with Peperomia Obtusifolia Even the most easygoing plants can have problems. Keep an eye out for the following issues that can usually be quickly remedied. Leaves Turning Yellow Baby rubber plants are sensitive to overwatering. Their usual glossy green leaves turn yellow to let you know it's getting too much water. Drooping Leaves Droopy, wilting leaves happen to baby rubber plants for a few reasons, such as too much light, too little water, or too much fertilizer. Plant Leaves Falling Off Sudden leaf drop may happen if your plant is experiencing abrupt and extreme temperature changes. Browning Tips Baby rubber plants do not thrive in cold homes where temperatures are 50°F or lower. Cold temperatures result in leaf tips turning brown. However, too much direct sun can cause leaf scorch and turn the plant's leaf tips brown. FAQ How long can Peperomia obtusifolia live? This easy-to-care-for plant lives for at least five years to over a decade with the right care and a suitable spot in your home. How do I retain the patternation on a variegated Peperomia obtusifolia? Peperomia obtusifolia with solid-colored leaves prefer filtered, indirect light but the variegated cultivars need a brighter spot to keep their variegation from fading. However, don't be tempted to put them in constant direct sunlight, which causes other problems. Can I grow Peperomia obtusifolia outdoors? Baby rubber plants are typically grown as houseplants because they survive in limited USDA hardiness zones. However, the plant grows outdoors in warm, humid regions, like Florida. What should I do with the flowers on my baby rubber plant? You can do one of two things with the flowers on your baby rubber plant. You can leave them alone and they will wither and die off. Or, you can pluck them off to help the plant grow bushier. Deadheading the tiny blooms may promote more blooms."

With its thick, glossy green leaves, the Baby Rubber Plant is just what you’ve been looking for. This is all about how to grow and care for a Peperomia obtusifolia. I’ve already done a post and video on general Peperomia care (all six I’m growing are easy). Still, due to its popularity, I wanted to do one dedicated solely to this succulent-like beauty. I live in the Sonoran Desert in Tucson, and my two Peperomia obtusifolia plants thrive. If they can handle the dry climate here (where the humidity averages 25-29%), they can handle the dry air in your home. Quite a few of my houseplants, especially my Dracaenas, have brown tips due to the dry air. My Baby Rubber Plants have no brown tips at all. How great is that?!

A baby rubber plant & a dracaena lemon surprise grow in a rectangular basket on a kitchen counter. The same basket a few years later. I’ve pruned the Baby Rubber Plant a few times, but I love how the stems grow outwards & upwards. The Dracaena Lemon Surprise will need its own pot soon. Uses This is used as a tabletop plant, in dish gardens, and terrariums. It’s also well suited to use in a houseplant living wall. Size As a houseplant, the average size is 12″ x 12″. It’s commonly sold in 4″ or 6″ grow pots. In my experience, it gets much wider. The mother plant growing in the white pot (in the lead photo and below) has been pruned and propagated two times. This plant meanders and trails as it grows. Right now, it’s 20″ wide and 17″ tall. My Variegated Baby Rubber Plant (which is younger) grows in a more upright form. You can always prune your Baby Rubber Plant to keep it more compact and upright. Growth Rate The Baby Rubber Plant grows moderately to fast in bright indirect light. The growth rate will be slower if the light conditions are lower than it prefers. Big Draw Even though this plant flowers (more on that towards the end), the deep green, glossy foliage and ease of care are its allure. There is also a Variegated Baby Rubber Plant if that’s more to your liking. Peperomia Obtusifolia Care A glossy green baby rubber plant in a white ceramic sits on a brick column outdoors. This is the mother plant. One of the babies is in the basket in the photo above. I’ve given away quite a few cuttings from this plant! There are numerous variegated forms of the Peperomia obtusifolia. If you have one of them, know the care points in this post apply to all. One difference: they need a bit more light to bring out and keep the beautiful variegation. Peperomia Obtusifolia Light Requirements The Peperomia obtusifolia is no different than many other houseplants. It prefers and does best in bright natural light – moderate or medium exposure. One of mine grows in my kitchen, 4′ away from a large northwest-facing window, and the other in the bathroom across from a large east-facing window. Keep yours out of hot, direct sunlight, as those thick, fleshy leaves will burn. I’ve never grown it in lower light, but I imagine it would tolerate lower to moderate conditions. You may not see much growth, though, if the light levels are too low. The variegated varieties of this plant need a bit more light. Peperomia Obtusifolia Watering Peperomia obtusifolias are succulent-like; they store water in their thick fleshy leaves, stems, and roots. You don’t want to overwater this epiphytic plant because it’ll succumb to root rot. I let mine go dry before watering again. In the summer, it’s once every 7-10 days, and in winter, every 14-18 days. I always tell you how often I water my specific houseplants so you have a guideline and can adjust the frequency to your conditions. Your Baby Rubber Plant might need watering less or more often. Many variables come into play, like the pot size, the type of soil it’s planted in, its growing location, and your home’s environment. The more light and warmth, the more often yours will need watering. Here’s a Guide to Watering Indoor Plants. This will help you in determining factors as to how often you water yours. Close up of the glossy leaves on a baby rubber plant growing in a plant basket. The foliage has a bit of variegation, but you have to get up close to notice. Temperature The average indoor temperature is fine. If your home’s comfortable, it’ll also be so for your houseplants. Keep your peperomias away from cold drafts and air conditioning or heating vents. Humidity In their native habitat, Peperomia obtusifolias grow in humid environments. One of the places it’s native to is southern Florida. It thrives in high humidity and loves it. The good news is I live in a desert climate, and mine are doing fine after five-plus years. I mist the foliage now and then. I like this mister because it’s small, easy to hold, and puts out a nice amount of spray. I’ve had it for over four years, and it’s still going strong. I also put my plants out in the rain two or three times a year for extra moisture and to clean the foliage off. Because they’re epiphytic in nature and their small root systems, they also collect water through their leaves. You could mist your Peperomia a couple of times a week if your home’s dry, and you think it needs it. Another option would be to fill a saucer with small rocks and water and then set the plant on top of that. The rock keeps the roots from submerging in the water. I have this humidity meter in my dining room. It’s inexpensive but does the trick and still works fine after a few years. I run my humidifiers when the humidity reads low, often in the Arizona desert! Do you have a lot of tropical plants? We have a whole guide on Plant Humidity that might interest you. A ripple peperomia a variegated peperomia & a green peperomia houseplants sit on brick column outdoors. Three of my other peperomias – all easy care too. Feeding / Fertilizer We have a long growing season here in the Sonoran Desert from mid-February through October. I fertilize with Maxsea or Sea Grow, Grow Big, and Liquid Kelp seven times during the growing season. It’s how I feed all my tropical plants. I alternate using these granular and liquid fertilizers and don’t mix them. Whatever houseplant food you choose, don’t over-fertilize your peperomias because salts build up and can burn the plant’s roots. This will show up as brown spots on the leaves. You want to avoid fertilizing any stressed houseplant, i.e., bone dry or soaking wet. I don’t fertilize houseplants in late fall or winter because it’s not their active growing season. Peperomia Obtusifolia Soil / Repotting Check the post and video highlighted below that focuses on the best time to repot, the steps to take, and the soil mix. In a nutshell, Baby Rubber Plants like a soil mix rich in organic matter, chunky, and well-draining. Their root systems are small, so they don’t need repotting often. I repot mine every four to six years to freshen the soil mix or if the roots are coming out the bottom. For example, I only increase one pot size from 4″ to 6″ or 6″ to 8″. Close up of baby rubber plant cuttings with roots. Look at these healthy roots. New growth is appearing out of the base too. You’ll want to check out this Peperomia Repotting Guide for all the details. Pruning Not much is needed regularly. I have to trim an occasional spent leaf off. The Baby Rubber Plant grows fast. You may have to prune yours to control the size and form. These plants are easy to propagate from stem cuttings, so that’s another reason for pruning. Check out how I Pruned & Propagated My Baby Rubber Plant. Peperomia Obtusifolia Propagation It’s easy to get a new plant or two. Peperomia obtusifolias propagate by stem cuttings (it is very easy to do in water), by taking leaf cuttings, and/or by dividing the plant. Propagating, like repotting, is best done in spring, summer, and early fall. You can see how I Planted My Baby Rubber Plant Cuttings here. Cat sits on kitchen counter next to a baby rubber plant in an orange plant basket. The good news, the Baby Rubber Plant is non-toxic to cats & dogs. That’s my Tazzy posing for the photo. I adopted him from Hope Animal Shelter about a year ago. He’s a very happy kitty! Pests My Peperomias have never gotten any. Maybe that’s because I regularly spray the foliage and stems with water in my kitchen sink. They can be susceptible to mealybugs, spider mites, and scale. As with any pests, keep your eye out for them and take control immediately. They spread from houseplant to houseplant very quickly. Pet Safety Hip hip hurrays, the Peperomia obtusifolia is a plant that the ASPCA lists as non-toxic for cats and dogs. My two kitties don’t pay much, if any, attention to my many houseplants.

    "content": "How to Care for a Peperomia Obtusifolia or Baby Rubber Plant It is official—the National Garden Bureau declared 2022 the Year of the Peperomia. “Peperomia are having their much-deserved time in the sun,” NGB shares, “though they have been sold as houseplants since the 1930s.” The genus is home to over 1,000 species that are diverse in appearance: some with heart or lance shaped leaves, others almond or oval shaped. Their leaves can be solid green, marbled or striped—even gray or red. Native to tropical areas like southern Florida and South & Central America, Peperomia plants can be found on the forest floor, making them tolerant of lower light conditions. If you aren’t sure if your plant is part of the Peperomia genus, wait for it to bloom. The National Garden Bureau says Peperomia’s “rat-tail” inflorescence, or cluster of flowers, is a way to recognize its species. However, Peperomia plants are not grown for their flowers, but for their beautiful foliage, easy-going nature, and pet-friendliness. The Peperomia Obtusifolia (Peperomia obtusifolia) is a succulent-like variety of Peperomia, originally found in the rainforests of South America. It is nicknamed the Baby Rubber Plant, although it is unrelated to Hevea brasiliensis, the primary resource of natural rubber, and Ficus elastica, commonly called the Rubber Tree. The Peperomia Obtusifolia is characterized by its thick, upright stems with glossy, spoon-shaped leaves, which store water. In its natural habit, the plants leaves will shrivel in drought and plump after it rains. The leaves are typically a vibrant green but can also have white-and-green variegation that resembles marbling. [product-card-1] How much sunlight does a peperomia need? Most varieties of Peperomia plants prefer medium to bright indirect light, but can tolerate low, indirect light. Peperomia plants are not suited for intense, direct sun. How often should you water a peperomia? Water every 1-2 weeks, allowing the potting soil to dry out between waterings. Expect to water more often when your cactus is in brighter light and less often in lower light. Native to the tropics, some of the less-succulent varieties of Peperomia can benefit from higher humidity. However, be mindful not to over water them. Leaves that yellow then drop, combined with moist potting mix, can be a sign of overwatering. What temperature does a peperomia prefer? Like most common houseplants, Peperomia plants prefer an average indoor temperature of 65°F to 75°F. If you’re comfortable in your space, your houseplants probably are, too. Remember to keep plants away from heating and cooling systems, or open doors and windows, that can cause temperature fluctuations and drafts. How big does a peperomia get? Plants from the Peperomia genus are popular houseplants because they are petite and compact. Indoors, most Peperomia plants will stay fairly small, never surpassing two feet tall. Are peperomia easy to care for? Peperomia are are generally easy houseplants to grow. They are resistant to most plant pests, however, treat pests as soon as they appear with weekly sprays of neem oil or an insecticide, and regular wipe-downs of the infected plant. Other common plant problems you can look out for are: SYMPTOM: Dull, fading leaves CAUSE: Too much direct sun SYMPTOM: Wilting, with dry potting mix CAUSE: Underwatered SYMPTOM: Wilting, plus leaf loss CAUSE: Overwatered SYMPTOM: Browning of leaf edges or tips CAUSE: Cold drafts Are peperomia safe to keep around pets? The Peperomia family is pet-friendly! Peperomia are non-toxic, making them safe to keep around your furry friends. However, the best practice is always to keep new houseplants out of reach of small children and curious pets just in case."

Although it naturally grows at ground level in the rainforest, it can be grown as a houseplant in our climate. Find out everything you need to know about caring for and propagating Peperomia obtusifolia. Contents Peperomia obtusifolia: origin and characteristics Peperomia obtusifolia is also known as the baby rubber plant, American rubber plant or pepper face. It is a succulent-like plant belonging to the pepper family known as Piperaceae and is a relative of the well-known pepper vine (Piper). The genus Peperomia is very diverse and even has a few edible species. Peperomia obtusifolia is native to the Caribbean, Florida and Mexico, where it grows as a carpet-forming herb in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are glossy, oval and rich green. Thanks to its water storage tissue in these leaves, the baby rubber plant can store water for a very long time. It grows upright and reaches a manageable height and width of 25 to 30 cm. Peperomia obtusifolia flowers are delicate and white and bloom between April and December. Close up of peperomia leaves Its rich green and glossy leaves make it a wonderfully decorative houseplant [Photo: Uut_Eco.J/ Shutterstock.com] Our favourite Peperomia obtusifolia varieties There are plenty of other Peperomia species, but there are also a few varieties of Peperomia obtusifolia that are worth taking a look at: Peperomia obtusifolia ‘Variegata’ is probably the best-known variety. This variegated peperomia’s leaves are beautifully marbled with creamy white to light green edges which contrasts nicely against the otherwise lush green colour. Variegata in small pot Peperomia obtusifolia ‘Variegata’ has beautifully variegated leaves [Photo: Jus_Ol/ Shutterstock.com] Peperomia obtusifolia ‘Albo marginata’ is a lesser-known variety that develops comparatively large leaves. Peperomia obtusifolia ‘Bohemian Bravour’ has dark green, shiny leaves and closely resembles the original species. Peperomia obtusifolia ‘Green Gold’ has leaves which can range in colour from a creamy white to a light green in brighter locations. Greengold variety in pot Peperomia obtusifolia ‘Greengold’ also has mottled leaves [Photo: awindrunner/ Shutterstock.com] Peperomia obtusifolia ‘Golden Gate’ has equally patterned, but rounder leaves. Close up of Golden Gate variety Peperomia obtusifolia ‘Golden Gate’ has rounded, variegated leaves [Photo: Traveller70/ Shutterstock.com] Planting and growing Peperomia obtusifolia: where, when and how Peperomia obtusifolia prefers a relatively bright location without direct sunlight, but does enjoy a little bit of morning sunlight. It should be kept somewhere relatively warm, ideally around 18 °C. While it can hack cooler temperatures during the winter, it will tolerate no lower than 10 °C. Like so many houseplants, Peperomia obtusifolia does not like cool draughts. When planting or repotting Peperomia obtusifolia, opt for a loose and well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging, as this can lead to root rot. While this relatively undemanding houseplant will grow in poorer and sandier soils, an organic and more nutrient-rich soil will help it to thrive. Our Plantura Organic All Purpose Compost is a peat-free compost that contains all the nutrients your plant needs. It has a relatively loose structure, which also helps to prevent waterlogging.

To plant your Peperomia obtusifolia, transfer it to a pot, fill the pot with suitable soil and water well. This plant also grows nicely in a hanging pot. Tip: Peperomia obtusifolia grows quite slowly, so go for a pot that isn’t too large or else water will linger in the unrooted substrate. Also make sure the pot has a drainage hole to prevent waterlogging. Peperomia being planted in pot Do not opt for too large a pot for your Peperomia obtusifolia [Photo: Boyloso/ Shutterstock.com] Peperomia obtusifolia care Peperomia obtusifolia only needs watering once the surface of the soil feels dry to the touch. To prevent root rot, ensure there is sufficient drainage and do not water too often. Greatly reduce how much you water in the winter months. These plants do not require a lot of nutrients either. That said, as the substrate loses nutrients over time, it is a good idea to fertilise from time to time. Fertilise your Peperomia every four weeks from spring to autumn. Our Plantura Liquid Houseplant Food is ideal for this and is convenient to apply. You simply dilute it into the water you use for watering.

Due to its tropical origins, Peperomia obtusifolia does prefer higher humidity, but will do perfectly fine at normal humidity levels. Tip: Regularly remove dust from your Peperomia obtusifolia. This not only makes the leaves look nice and shiny, but also allows the plant to photosynthesise more efficiently. Peperomia leaves being dusted It is important to dust off the leaves with a damp cloth [Photo: bearmoney/ Shutterstock.com] As baby rubber plants are slow growers, they will only need repotting about every four years. However, we recommend replacing the soil with fresh (and thus more nutritious) soil every two years. Repot your Peperomia obtusifolia into a larger pot once the roots start growing out of the top or peaking through the drainage holes at the bottom. The best time to repot is in the spring, before the active growth period. This is also the ideal time to prune the tips of the shoots to encourage bushier growth. Peperomia obtusifolia is generally a very robust plant and is not particularly susceptible to diseases or pests. However, a plant in poor health is more vulnerable to spider mites, mealybugs and scale insects. Peperomia obtusifolia losing leaves? This is usually a sign of overwatering or improper growing conditions. To remedy this, create a drainage layer and pour off excess water from the trivet after watering. Also, check that you are keeping your Peperomia in a bright enough location with the right humidity level. Peperomia plant in shade You can place your young Peperomia obtusifolia plant outside in a shady spot during the summer [Photo: CHARINRUT/ Shutterstock.com] Propagating Peperomia obtusifolia Propagating Peperomia obtusifolia is quite simple, can be done at any time of year, and works particularly well with stem cuttings. Here is how to go about doing this: Get a clean and sharp knife Cut off an approximately 13 cm long young shoot above a leaf Now cut the shoot to just below the first leaf from the cut end Tip: To increase the chances of success, take several cuttings at once. There is no guarantee that all of them will form roots. Remove half of the lower leaves and place the cutting into potting soil Plantura Organic Herb & Seeding Compost is ideal for cuttings as it is low in nutrients and therefore stimulates root growth For better drainage and to prevent the cutting from rotting, mix about a third of sand into the soil Press the soil down a little and moisten it Place the cutting in a bright and warm place at around 18 °C To increase the humidity, place a plastic bag over the pot Remove the plastic bag once a day to prevent mould from growing If all goes well, it should take three to six weeks for your Peperomia obtusifolia cutting to start growing some roots. Peperomia in pot after propagation A successfully propagated Peperomia obtusifolia [Photo: Boyloso/ Shutterstock.com] Is Peperomia obtusifolia poisonous? No, Peperomia obtusifolia is not poisonous, neither for us humans, nor for cats and dogs. Nevertheless, as this is a houseplant and not an agricultural crop, we advise against consuming any part of the plant. Originally from Africa, sugarbushes (Protea) also come from tropical regions. Unlike Peperomia, these beautiful plants can reach up to 10 metres high. However, this genus also offers species of a smaller, more manageable height that are ideal as houseplants."

There are more than 100 species in the genus, but the most popular kalanchoe houseplant is kalanchoe blossfeldiana, or window's thrill. It grows clusters of tiny flowers in red, pink, yellow, orange, and white. a kalanchoe plant with white blooms Credit: Alonda Baird / The Spruce Kalanchoe is a popular houseplant because it's drought tolerant and easy to grow, needing water maybe every other week when kept in its ideal bright lighting. In tropical and subtropical climates, it can be grown outdoors as a perennial. In colder climates, it's typically grown as an indoor plant. With the right care, it can rebloom indoors for decades. Be careful keeping it with pets though, since the plant is toxic to cats and dogs when eaten.1 Common Name Kalanchoe, flaming Katy, florists kalanchoe, Christmas kalanchoe Botanical Name Kalanchoe blossfeldiana Family Crassulaceae Plant Type Perennial, succulent Mature Size 6–18 in. tall and wide Sun Exposure Full sun, partial shade Soil type Sandy, well-drained Soil pH Acidic, neutral, slightly alkaline Bloom Time Seasonal bloomer Flower Color Yellow, red, orange, salmon, pink, white Hardiness Zones 10–12 (USDA) Native Area Africa (Madagascar) Toxicity Toxic to pets1 Kalanchoe Care Caring for kalanchoe is easy with a few basic tips and the right conditions. The main growing requirements for kalanchoe are: Plant kalanchoe in loose, loamy, sandy, well-drained potting medium like cactus mix or soil used for succulents. Place kalanchoe in a warm indoor location with bright, indirect light. or place it in a full sun outdoor location that has protection from late afternoon sun. Allow kalanchoe plants to dry out completely between waterings. Fertilize indoor kalanchoe plants once per month during spring and summer. closeup of kalanchoe blossoms Credit: Alonda Baird / The Spruce Light Kalanchoe plants grown indoors do best with bright, indirect light. Plant outdoor kalanchoes in partial shade to full sun. When planted in full sun, it's ideal for it to receive some afternoon shade to protect it from scorching. Leggy stems are a sign that the plant isn't receiving enough light. Soil Indoor kalanchoe plants should be potted in a well-draining porous blend, like a 50% potting soil and 50% cactus mix, or 60% potting soil and 40% perlite. Outdoors, a kalanchoe plant grows best in well-draining, loamy or sandy soil. Water Kalanchoe does well with minimal water, requiring waterings only every few weeks or so. Let the soil dry out completely in between waterings to help prevent root rot. Temperature and Humidity Generally, your kalanchoe will thrive at temperatures between 55°F and 80°F. With the exception of protecting it from frost, you don't have to do much to create a proper indoor environment. Kalanchoe plants are not fussy about humidity. As outdoor garden plants, kalanchoes will not thrive outside of USDA hardiness zones 10 to 12 because they don't thrive at temperatures below 55°F. Fertilizer Indoor kalanchoe should be fed with a well-balanced fertilizer blend once a month during the spring and summer months, but not in winter. If flowering is sparse, switch to a fertilizer that is higher in phosphorus. Like most flowering plants, kalanchoe benefits from fertilizer, though they's not heavy feeders. Garden-grown plants require only a single light feeding in the spring. Growth Rate Kalanchoes are generally slow growing, taking between two and five years to reach mature size. Paddle plant can grow to more than two feet tall at maturity, while cathedral bells and velvet-leaf kalanchoe can grow up to 5 or 6 feet tall inside.2 Kalanchoes grown outdoors tend to grow more quickly because they're in brighter conditions. Care for Kalanchoe Indoors Place in bright, indirect light—in an south- or west-facing window is ideal. Water deeply after soil has mostly dried out. Fertilize during the growing season (around April to September). Repot every year or two.

Types of Kalanchoe Beach bells (K. manginii): This species sometimes known as chandelier plant features fleshy leaves and bears large, bell-like pendant flowers. Moist air is essential for flowering. Mother of thousands (Kalanchoe daigremontiana): This species of kalanchoe is commonly known for the tiny plantlets that grow along the edges of its leaves. Pearl bells (K. porphyrocalyx): This species consists of slender, rectangular leaves and purple pendant flowers. Chandelier plant (Kalanchoe delagoensis): This kalanchoe is known for the way its tubular orange flowers hang down from the top of its stems. Felt plant (K. beharensis): This kalanchoe species is hardy in USDA hardiness zones 9 to 11. It's prized for its large, pale silvery green fuzzy leaves. Paddle plant (Kalanchoe luciae): A common houseplant, this kalanchoe earned its name for its flat, rounded leaves, which can develop red edges in winter. Cathedral bells (K. pinnata): This kalanchoe species has fleshy green leaves and bears tiny plantlets along its margins. Chocolate soldier plant (Kalanchoe tomentosa): This kalanchoe has thick, fuzzy leaves with a blue tinge and brown spots around their edges. Kalanchoe blossfeldiana Credit: The Spruce / Alonda Baird Kalanchoe porphyrocalyx Kalanchoe beharensis Kalanchoe pinnata Pruning Pinching back the stems of a kalanchoe plant will help maintain its shape and promote more robust blooming. Trim off any dead flowers to keep the plant looking neat and encourage new growth. This is especially important to do during the plant's resting period in late winter and early spring. Pests to Watch As new leaves come in on a kalanchoe plant, watch out for aphids. These insects love to feed on young leaves. Check the undersides, and if present remove them with a spray of water. Propagating Kalanchoe The growing offsets will draw energy away from the mother kalanchoe plant. Pruning the offsets and propagating them will allow the mother plant to continue to thrive and give you several more plants. Besides propagating the offsets, you can also take stem cuttings. Here's how to take stem cuttings and propagate kalanchoe offsets. Cut a piece of stem. Cut a segment of stem several inches long from a mature plant using a sharp clean knife or clippers. If using an offset, remove it at the joint where it connects to the parent plant. Let cutting dry out. Allow the cutting to dry out for a few days, or until the end appears to have healed shut and calloused over. Dip in rooting hormone. Dip the calloused ends of the cutting in a rooting hormone. Plant in soil. Plant the cutting in soil comprised of the same mixture used to grow the mother plant. Place in bright, indirect light. Place the newly planted cutting in bright indirect light, but do not water it; the stem should take root within a month, at which point you can care for it as you would a mature kalanchoe plant. Potting and Repotting Kalanchoe Kalanchoe should be repotted regularly to allow for new growth; it does not like to be rootbound. Repotting once a year should be fine. The best time to repot a kalanchoe is in the fall after the plant is finished blooming. If the plant's roots have filled the pot, choose a container that is 1 inch larger in diameter. If the plant's root system isn't filling the pot, you can keep it in the same pot and add a fresh layer of soil on top. Choose a well-draining pot, with at least one drainage hole. A pot made of a porous material, like clay or terracotta, can also be helpful because the pot can leach moisture from the soil. Overwintering Kalanchoe In cooler climates, you can relocate indoor kalanchoe plants to the outdoors once night time temperatures are above 60°F. Bring them indoors when temperatures dip in late summer or early fall. If your kalanchoe is exposed to temperatures below freezing (32°F) it may die, so a good rule of thumb is to bring it inside when overnight temperatures dip below 55°F. In USDA hardiness zones 9 through 11, kalanchoe plants can often survive a frost, even if their foliage dies back. In colder climates, however, they won't survive frost damage. Kalanchoe plants need less water in winter than they do in spring or summer. Allow the soil to dry out fully between waterings. Moving Kalanchoe Outside You can take your kalanchoe outside once nighttime temperatures are above 65°F. Start with a few hours in the shade each day; leave it outside for more and more time to acclimate it to the sun. The best outdoor location is a spot that gets morning sun and is protected from afternoon light. How to Get Kalanchoe to Bloom Kalanchoes require bright sunlight during the day to bloom properly. Harsh direct sunlight can actually inhibit blooming, so bright, indirect light is ideal. How to Keep Kalanchoe Blooming For your kalanchoe plant to bloom to its full potential, it should be located somewhere it gets at least 6 to 8 hours of bright light each day. During the fall and winter, the plant should experience near total darkness for the other hours of the day. A full 14 hours of daily darkness for at least six weeks is necessary for the plant to amass energy for further blooms. Roughly four months later, in spring, you'll be treated to bursts of colorful flowers that can last several weeks. How to Make Kalanchoe Flower More Than Once a Year With the proper care and environment, kalanchoes can bloom year-round indoors. Once one bloom period is done, remove the spent flowers to discourage it from putting energy into them. You have to then replicate its period of darkness to try to trick it into blooming again. Put it into darkness (under a box would be good) for at least 14 hours a day. Give it minimal light the rest of the time. Do not fertilize and avoid watering. About six weeks later, you should see flower buds at which point you can resume regular care. How to Encourage More Blooms Deadheading the flowers once blooms are spent is another way to prompt continual kalanchoe flowering. If you're struggling with getting your plant to flower, look for a fertilizer blend that is high in phosphorus, which can help produce more buds. Get What Your Kalanchoe Needs A grow light will give your kalanchoe the 6 to 8 hours of bright light it needs. Good pruners are necessary to keep the plant producing more flowers A fertilizer blend will get you more blooms. Common Problems With Kalanchoe Kalanchoe plants are very easy to grow, but problems can arise when they are not watered correctly or if they experience temperature extremes. Soft, Damaged Blooms and Leaves Plants that are touched by near-freezing temperatures will often experience damaged leaves or stunted blooms. For best performance, keep these plants at temperatures above 50°F. Wilting Temperatures that are too high can cause leaves to wilt. Ideally, keep these plants below 80°F. Drab or Burned Leaves Proper light exposure is key to good-looking plants. Too little light and the leaves will lose the trademark glossy green. Too much direct sunlight and you can expect burned leaves. Indoor kalanchoes will do best in a location that receives a lot of bright indirect light, but not too much direct sunlight. Soft, Fragile Stems A very common problem with kalanchoe is overwatering or planting in a soil medium that holds water. Excessive water can easily cause root and stem rot with these plants. If you see this problem beginning, withhold water until the plant recovers. Kalanchoe Not Blooming When a kalanchoe doesn't bloom, it's usually because the plant didn't get the lengthy period of winter darkness that allows the plant to reset its bloom cycle. During the winter months, these plants need a six-week period where they experience nighttime darkness lasting a full 14 hours each day. Without this reset period, the plants usually fails to bloom.

Kalanchoe generally have a lifespan of a several decades when given the right care. The plants will bloom annually with the right care. (Just because the bloom period has ended doesn't mean the plant is dead.) Is kalanchoe best grown as an indoor or outdoor plant? Kalanchoe is best grown as a houseplant, though in USDA hardiness zones 10 to 12 they can be grown outdoors year round. You can acclimate indoor kalanchoes to the outdoors in spring and leave them outside until temperatures begin to cool in late summer and early fall. Do kalanchoe plants work well in mixed containers? Kalanchoe works well in mixed containers when planted alongside other succulents like aloe and jade, though it is usually planted by itself in a container. On a patio, kalanchoes are often planted with sedums and other creeping plants. Do kalanchoe plants grow back every year? Yes, as perennial succulents kalanchoe plants will grow back every year as long as it's grown inside as a houseplant or outside in USDA zones 10 to 12. With proper care, even kalanchoe grown indoors will rebloom annually. Where should you put a kalanchoe plant? To give kalanchoe the bright, indirect light it needs, place it in or near a south- or west-facing window. How many times a year does kalanchoe bloom? Kalanchoe usually blooms just once a year for a few months in late winter or early spring. Outdoors it might bloom more often. If you want it to bloom more frequently indoors, you have to manipulate the growing conditions and trick the plant into thinking it's time to bloom again."

Native to Madagascar and other tropical regions of Africa, Kalanchoe are succulents with thick, fleshy leaves that compliment their long-lasting flowers. K blossfeldiana is hardy outdoors in zones 10-12, where it can be grown as a perennial — it begins to suffer in temperatures lower than 45 degrees Fahrenheit and thus, must be grown as a houseplant in cooler grow zones. Read on and learn how! Types and Cultivars of Kalanchoes to Try There are well over 100 different Kalanchoe varieties, with the most popular being the Kalanchoe blossfeldiana. Also try: Kalanchoe blossfeldiana 'Queen Jodie': this Kalanchoe boasts elegant pink double blooms that almost resemble tiny roses. Kalanchoe blossfeldiana ‘Flaming Katy’: with its vivid clusters of bright red flowers, this cultivar has certainly earned the “flaming” namesake. Kalanchoe tomentosa: known as Panda Plant, this succulent offers an intriguing texture with its fuzzy leaves; a great addition to a sensory garden! Kalanchoe thyrsiflora: with its large, paddle-like leaves, this succulent is often known as Flapjacks plant, and is sometimes confused with the more common and nearly identical K. luciae. Best Conditions For Kalanchoe Light: Kalanchoes thrive in bright, indirect sunlight. A south-facing window that receives plenty of light is ideal. While they can tolerate some direct sunlight, too much can cause their leaves to scorch. Soil: As succulents, Kalanchoes do not like waterlogged roots. Use a well-draining potting mix, ideally one formulated for cacti, or mix your own, using a 1:1 ratio of regular potting mix and gritty gravel. Humidity: As a drought-tolerant succulent, Kalanchoes are suited to arid conditions and will handlee standard room humidity just fine. How To Care For Kalanchoes Watering As succulents, Kalanchoes need minimal water. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and then water deeply. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so it’s important to avoid letting the plant sit in water. Fertilizing Kalanchoes are not heavy feeders and will thrive without any fertilizer. Should you choose to fertilize, use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer diluted to half-strength during the summer growing season. Pruning Pruning isn’t usually necessary, but deadheading spent flowers can encourage new blooms. You can also prune back leggy growth to maintain a compact, bushy shape. When grown indoors as a houseplant, most Kalanchoe remain around 12 inches tall. Repotting Regular repotting can encourage Kalanchoe to pump out more blooms! Repot Kalanchoes in fresh potting mix every 1-2 years. Choose a container that’s slightly larger than the current one and ensure it has good drainage. Clay or terracotta pots dry quickly and can also promote good drainage. Propagation Kalanchoes are easy to propagate. You can do this by leaf or stem cuttings. Simply place the cuttings in soil, and they will root and grow into new plants. Common Problems with Kalanchoes Pests and Diseases: Common pests include aphids and mealybugs. Keep an eye out for signs of infestation, such as sticky residue on leaves or small, cottony spots. Signs of Stress: The most common problem is overwatering, which can lead to root rot. Leaves will start to yellow and stems may feel soft and mushy. Toxicity Kalanchoes are toxic to pets if ingested, particularly cats and dogs. It’s best to keep these plants out of reach of curious pets. Kalanchoes FAQs Q: Why are my Kalanchoe's leaves turning yellow? A: Yellowing leaves can be a sign of overwatering or poor drainage. Ensure your potting mix is well-draining and allow the soil to dry out between waterings. Q: How can I get my Kalanchoe to bloom again? A: Like chrysanthemums, Kalanchoe are “short-day plants”. To encourage blooming, Kalanchoes need short daylight hours for about 6 weeks. You can achieve this by placing the plant in complete darkness for 14 hours a day and then returning it to its normal spot. Q: Can I grow Kalanchoe outside in a planter? A: Yes! Hardy as a perennial in zones 10-12, Kalanchoe can also be grown as an annual in a container. Pair them in a planter with small aloes, a low-growing sedum, and other plants that have relatively low water requirements. Brighten your indoor AND outdoor space with a splash of bold color! Kalanchoe are hardy plants, well-suited for gardeners of all levels, from beginners looking for an easy-care plant, to more experienced enthusiasts seeking a challenge in propagation."

Quick Kalanchoe Facts: Botanical name- Kalanchoe blossfeldiana Height- 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) Spread- 6-36 inches (15-91 cm) Sun exposure- Full Soil requirements- Well draining Hardiness zones- USDA 8-11 When to plant- Spring Kalanchoes are one of those commonly found gift plants in floral departments of grocery stores, nursery center shelves, and even in hospital gift centers. The beautiful long-lasting rose-shaped blooms come in a range of colors. The kalanchoe plant is a succulent and is easy to care for and grow. Lucky owners of a kalanchoe plant can look forward to flowers on the plant for at least a month or more. The gently scalloped leaves and appealing bushy form combine to make an eye-catching plant. Caring for a kalanchoe isn’t difficult, but getting it to rebloom can be tricky. Kalanchoe Plant Care Kalanchoe plants are native to Madagascar. They are members of the stonecrop family, a group of half-hardy succulents. These perennials, however, are only hardy to USDA zones 8-11. In most areas, this means they can go outdoors in summer, but must be brought in for winter.

In their native range, they thrive in a sunny climate with at least 8 hours per day of light. In dimmer homes, an artificial plant light can provide supplemental light. Kalanchoes growing in less sunlight will get leggy as the stems stretch to get more sun, but strong, southern light can burn the tips of the leaves. Turn kalanchoe plants daily to keep excess growth from occurring that can make the plant unbalanced. Water The key to watering kalanchoe plants is good drainage to avoid root rot. Like most succulents, kalanchoe plants do not like wet feet. They thrive when there is a dry period before watering. Allow the soil to dry almost completely before watering thoroughly and deeply. Do not set containers on a saucer where water can collect. Temperature & Humidity This plant is from a warm region of the world and has no cold hardiness. In the home, it prefers temperatures of at least 60 degrees Fahrenheit (16 C). This cooler temperature will keep the blooms on the plant longer. After the plant has lost its flowers it may be kept in temperatures up to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 C). The succulent is a short day plant that needs cooler temperatures and shorter periods of light in the fall to encourage reblooming. Soil To flourish, kalanchoe requires a well-draining soil medium. Potting soil is sufficient with proper watering techniques. A homemade medium of 60 percent peat and 40 percent perlite is a perfect mixture. A mix of 50 percent potting soil and 50 percent cactus mix will also work. Outdoor plants in warmer regions can be installed in the ground in well-draining loam or sandy soil.

Fertilizer Caring for kalanchoe indoors includes a program of feeding. During the growing season when the plant is actively producing new shoots and leaves, fertilize it with a balanced houseplant food once per month. During fall and winter months, the plant will sort of hibernate and suspend new growth. Stop fertilizing during this period and resume in spring. Problems, Pests & Diseases Indoor kalanchoe plants rarely have any pest issues, but the most common problems stem from overwatering. Use a soil moisture meter until you get used to the plant’s needs. Water it less in winter when it is not active. Outdoor plants are prey to mealybugs, aphids, scale, and other sucking insects. Use a spray of rubbing alcohol to eradicate these pests. How to Plant Kalanchoe Outdoor plants are best installed in spring when the soil has warmed and there is no danger of frost. Indoor-grown kalanchoe plants will need repotting every few years. Slightly increase the size of the container as needed but don’t leave too much open soil exposed. Like any purchased plant, gently fluff the roots out into the planting container before backfilling with soil. Pruning Kalanchoe Kalanchoes don’t need pruning, but pinching off stems that have become leggy will enforce tighter growth. This is best done in early spring. Any dead or damaged plant material may be removed at any time. Kalanchoe Propagation Kalanchoe plants, as they are succulents, are easy to propagate. In spring to early summer, cut off a 2- to 3-inch (5-7.5 cm) piece from a vegetative stem. The cutting should have 2 pairs of leaves, 1 set of which is removed at the bottom. Let the cutting callus on the counter for a few days and then insert the cut end into a peat/perlite mixture that’s been premoistened. Place the container in a plastic bag to maintain high humidity. Remove the bag once per day to let excess condensation evaporate. Expect roots in 10-14 days. Reblooming Although the foliage of kalanchoe plants is interesting even without blooms, the flowers make the most spectacular display. To force the plant to bloom again, you must fool it into believing it has experienced winter. During October and early March, the day lengths are short enough to naturally force flower buds. In other periods, you will have to put the plant in a closet or dim room for most of the day. Bring it out only for morning light and then put it away after a few hours. The plant needs six weeks of 12 to 14 hours of darkness to form spectacular new flowers. The best temperatures for the formation of flowers are 40-45 F. (4-7 C.) at night and 60 F. (16 C.) during the day. Repotting An important part of Kalanchoe care is repotting. The plant will need new soil or other growing medium every couple of years. As it outgrows its container, it will require a slightly larger pot. Use good a quality medium and select a container that is just slightly larger than the width of the plant. Kalanchoe Types While kalanchoe blossfeldiana is the most commonly found form of the Kalanchoe family, there are around 120 species in the genus. Most of these are native to tropical Africa. Another form of kalanchoe that has become popular is the paddle or flapjacks plant. It has broad, flat, rounded leaves that resemble a stack of pancakes. Chocolate soldier is a fuzzy gray rosette form, often found with cacti. Devil’s backbone has slender stems with curved leaves adorned by tiny rosettes. Many specialty kalanchoes may be found in the desert or in rare plant nurseries. Frequently Asked Questions Is Kalanchoe an Indoor or Outdoor Plant? Kalanchoe plants have little frost tolerance and are mostly grown indoors. That doesn’t mean they can’t be moved outdoors during the summer, but they must come indoors before any cold spell threatens. In the USDA zones 8-11, the plant may be grown outdoors year-round. How Do You Keep Kalanchoe Blooming? As a short day plant, Kalanchoes need a little prompting in the form of temperature and light to rebloom. In fall, situate the plant a bit away from the window that gets the longest amount of light. Ideally, the plant should get no more than 10 hours of light for 6 weeks. This must be combined with daytime temperatures of 65-70 (18-21 C), and nighttime temperatures around 60 Fahrenheit (16 C)."

Also known as Flaming Katy or Christmas Kalanchoe, this plant is native to Madagascar and is loved for its ease of care, making it a great choice for both beginner and experienced gardeners. With its vibrant, brightly colored flowers that can last up to eight to twelve weeks, and its waxy, scalloped foliage, the Kalanchoe Blossfeldiana is a cherished symbol of generosity and kindness, making it the perfect gift for those you love most. With proper care, this plant will thrive and bring a touch of tropical beauty to your space. Kalanchoe is a highly sought-after houseplant that loves dry climates. Gardening enthusiasts are drawn to this plant for its low maintenance, eye-catching leaves, and ability to produce beautiful flowers again and again with the right amount of light exposure! Other common names Florist Kalanchoe Flaming Katy Christmas kalanchoe Madagascar Widow's-Thrill How Often Should I Water My Kalanchoe Blossfeldiana With easyplant, watering your Kalanchoe is simple. Make sure to check the easyplant reservoir once a month and fill it when empty, and you're all set! Water every 1 Month If you don't have an Easyplant pot, monitor your Kalanchoes' water levels and provide them with water every ten days or two weeks. To check if it's time for watering, feel the soil about 3-4 inches deep - once dried out completely, it is time for water. If the leaves start wilting, that indicates they are far overdue for a drink of water. Because the Flaming Katy is a succulent, it's important not to overwater. Too much water can cause root rot, which is a serious problem for this type of plant. Overwatering also causes the leaves to fall off and prevents your Kalanchoe from flowering. Self-watering with easyplant is an ideal solution to this problem! Kalanchoe Blossfeldiana Light Needs Kalanoche Blossfeldiana grows best in a space with bright direct light, where the sunlight streams inside directly, and can also adapt to spaces with bright indirect light, where the sun rays are diffused. Avoid placing it in spaces with low light or spaces without natural sunlight. Kalanchoe can survive in lower-light environments, provided the climate remains warm. They need several hours of unfiltered daylight daily - preferably from a south-facing window during winter and indirect light (or an east/west window) for summertime. If your Kalanchoe is looking weak with long thin stems, chances are it's not receiving ample sunlight! Light requirement ab Kalanchoe Blossfeldiana Plant Care Kalanchoe care is relatively easy and straightforward. These plants need a fair bit of direct sunlight during the day, but they do not like to be in full sun all the time. Rotate your pot by 1/4 turn monthly to ensure all sides get equal exposure and monitor the soil for dryness. During the first few days after bringing your Kalanchoe blossfeldiana home, it is normal for it to lose several leaves or for the leaves to turn brown. This is simply part of the plant's adjustment process and there is no need to be concerned. If you see a leaf or two that needs to be trimmed, simply shake it off or cut it off and look forward to new, better-adjusted leaves growing in. Pruning is also essential for maintaining healthy growth and size. Prune off dead or damaged leaves as soon as they appear. Additionally, Kalanchoe, like other flowering plants, benefits from 'deadheading'. When its blooms begin to fade and die off, it's advisable to remove them. This practice allows the plant to focus its energy on creating new blooms and maintaining overall health. Remember, regularly removing spent flowers is a normal part of care for plants that bloom. Lastly, be sure to keep the plant in an area with ample airflow. This will help your Kalanchoe remain strong and healthy for years to come! How Big Do Kalanchoe Blossfeldiana Plants Grow? Thriving in bright light and dry climates, Kalanchoe blossfeldiana is a slow-growing plant that can reach 8 to 12 inches in height when grown indoors. Kalanchoes prefer to be kept on the dry side and, for optimal growth, should not be over-watered. Its wide, oval leaves are often vibrant and beautiful even when not blooming, adding character and life to any space. It usually takes between two and five years for Kalanchoe to attain its full size. Temperature & Humidity Florists' Kalanchoe flourishes best in temperatures of 60 degrees Fahrenheit at night and 70 during the day, while anything above 75 may impede its flowering process. Fortunately, as a succulent plant species, this variety is resilient to moisture stress. To ensure successful growth and development, relative humidity should remain consistently between 75-85 percent. High humidity levels of above 90 percent can lead to a decrease in leaves and the yellowing of leaf spots, along with damage to flower heads and buds. Are Kalanchoe Blossfeldiana Toxic for Pets & Kids? Although Kalanchoe plants are not typically lethal to humans, they can be incredibly dangerous when consumed by pets. Humans may experience nausea and vomiting as a result of ingesting this plant. Every aspect of the plant is poisonous - from its foliage and flowers down to the water it sits in. Kalanchoe ingestion can be toxic and even fatal for any pet, as it disrupts their body's ability to regulate electrolytes which can induce abnormal heart rate, seizures, and even death. Furthermore, this poisonous plant also impacts the gastrointestinal system and nervous systems of pets. Therefore, it's important for those with cats or dogs at home to keep an eye out for any potential risks posed by these common houseplants. Troubleshooting Common Problems with Kalanchoe Blossfeldiana If you find that your Kalanchoe isn't doing well, there are a few common problems to look out for. These issues usually manifest in discoloration or yellowing of leaves, stunted growth, and wilting. The most common cause of these problems is incorrect watering. Kalanchoes need a moderate amount of water, not too much and not too little. Too little will reflect in brown leaves, while too much might cause root rot. To check if your plant has root rot, gently remove it from the pot and look for signs of decay. Repot with fresh soil if necessary. If you are using an easyplant pot, be sure to refill the reservoir every month, and you should have no problem. If you are watering manually, check the soil 3-4 inches deep - if it is dry, then it's time for water. Kalanchoe plants are often plagued by mealybugs, aphids, and brown scales. Keep an eye out for white cottony masses on leaves and stems (mealybugs), small green or black insects clustered on new growth (aphids), and brown circular bumps on stems and leaves (brown scales). To treat them, you can use a mixture of water and dish soap, neem oil, or insecticidal soap sprays. Regularly inspecting your plants and acting quickly can help keep these pests under control. To prevent the further spread of pests, isolating infested plants from other healthy ones is advisable.
