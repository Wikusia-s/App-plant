         "https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/houseplants/peace-lily/peace-lily-blooming.htm",
         "Why Your Peace Lily Won’t Bloom & Tips To Make It Flower Many houseplant parents ask us how to make a peace lily bloom. The peace lily is a very common houseplant that’s only outdoor-hardy in USDA zones 10-11, but the plant thrives in low-light situations, making it perfect for indoor office decor. While the glossy, green leaves are attractive, most gardeners buy the plant for its inflorescence. The cupped, creamy white, spathe enfolds the spadix and enhances the greenery. But once the bloom is finished, can you make it bloom again? Peace lily flowering takes quite a bit of patience, and the right conditions. Peace Lily Flowering Stages In a commercial setting, peace lilies are grown in carefully controlled environments. This is to ensure that the plants are flowering by the time they’re displayed for purchase. This member of the Arum family doesn’t produce an actual flower but instead a flower-like modified leaf, the spathe. A blooming peace lily is beautiful and getting the plant to produce the spathe again is a gardener’s challenge. The spathe is long-lasting but will eventually turn green and then brown when it is done. During its life cycle, the plant buds, blooms, sets seed, then the flower wilts. When Does a Peace Lily Bloom? Purchased peace lilies have been forced to bloom. Professional growers treat the plant with gibberellic acid. Known as GA in the trade, this substance is a plant hormone that drives blooming, among other things. It is a natural product derived from the Gibberella fujikuroi fungus that occurs on rice plants. After spraying the plant with GA, the flower will be produced around 70 days later. The plants generally bloom in mid-spring, around April, with the flower lasting over a month. How Often Does a Peace Lily Bloom? Peace lilies produce blooms once the growing season begins and may occasionally produce a flower in early fall. Getting 2 annual blooms requires exacting conditions that mimic those of their native range in the tropical forests of Columbia and Venezuela. The plant must have the perfect light, proper temperatures and humidity to form even 1 flower. Why Is My Peace Lily Not Flowering? A peace lily not flowering is a very common occurrence; the internet is flooded with searches about the peace lily not blooming. Once the spathe fades and it is cut away from the plant, the peace lily is often kept just as a foliage plant, never to bloom again. Indoor home conditions are rarely optimal for generating another bloom, but structured changes to the environment or growing the plant in a controlled area can force it to flower. Not Enough Light Peace lilies (Spathyphyllum) are understory plants that receive filtered light through the tree canopy. They like low light but too little light will prevent the plant from blooming. Most of the time it thrives in light as low as 20 candles, but when you want it to bloom, this amount must be increased. The plant will respond to the short day-long-night photoperiod of fall and winter by forming a bud. But, except a few cultivars, these plants will not form buds during the long-day-short night part of the year. Wrong Time of Year This photoperiodism response is typical of many plants. Light changes are sensed by photoreceptors that in turn cause hormonal changes. Auxins are plant hormones that drive new growth. They are what informs the plant that it is time to bloom. Peace lily is a short-day response plant. So plants will begin to form buds in the cooler season and fully flower when the days become longer. Plant Isn’t Old Enough A peace lily must be several years old before it will flower. While studies have shown younger plants produce more flowers, very old plants may simply stop producing blooms. Young plants will generally produce a bloom in about 15 months in perfect conditions. How to Make a Peace Lily Bloom Peace lily plants respond not only to light changes, but to temperature and humidity levels. To encourage the plant to bloom, move it to a slightly brighter location. Plants that undergo a chilling period of 54 degrees Fahrenheit (12 C) for a few weeks will flower earlier than those in warmer temperatures. The optimal average temperature year round is 72 F (22 C). The plants also enjoy significant humidity. In homes with central heating, they often do not receive enough ambient moisture. Mist the leaves daily or place the container on a saucer filled with pebbles and water. This will evaporate and increase the humidity around the plant. The plant does not need much fertilizer but the chance of a bloom increases with an application of balanced fertilizer every 6 to 8 weeks during the growing season. Removing spent flowers will encourage plants to rebloom. Avoid placing the plant near drafts and allow it to become pot bound. With a little luck, the plant will bloom again."

         "As far as plants that are given as gifts go, the peace lily is by far the most popular houseplant to be gifted in the UK. This is great, because peace lilies are amazing gifts and even more amazing as plants. But peace lilies are not always easy to look after, meaning that many peace lilies sadly perish each year - often needlessly. Don't worry though, this guide will ensure that a peace lily will never again suffer at the hands of a human again - with our complete guide to keeping your peace lily healthy. Why Peace Lilies Make Lovely Houseplants To begin with, here are some fun facts about the peace lily, starting with the fact it has a really silly sounding Latin name - spathiphyllum wallisii. Aside from their silly Latin name, they have some other interesting characteristics. They are native to a tropical climate and grow in the wild in central America and northern South America. This means that they are well suited to growing in our warm and cosy homes because this is somewhat similar to their native environment. Something that is unusual for a plant that grows in rainforests is that the peace lily doesn't need too much water to survive (more on this further down). Peace lilies aren't just peaceful by name, they also are among the super plants that NASA identified in their clean air study. This study was essentially to determine which plants would be best to grow in space for the purposes of cleaning air. Peace lilies were found to reduce the amount of formaldehyde and benzene in the air, both chemicals that are found in household products. The peace lily is also NOT a lily. Lilies are toxic to pets like cats and dogs, but the peace lily isn't nearly as toxic to our furry friends. It really does come in peace, mostly, as it will probably cause discomfort if ingested by humans or animals. The Right Conditions for Your Peace Lily Peace lilies are relatively easy to grow at home and the key to their care is less is more. Oftentimes well meaning giftees will put their peace lily on the windowsill in direct sunlight, which isn't terrible, but it isn't beneficial. Peace lilies grow in partial shade conditions and even do well in low light conditions. Watering Requirements Peace lilies need watering, but not nearly as much as you might expect. Normally it is best to water your peace lily every few days with the plant even being tolerant to being watered less often if it is kept somewhere humid in the house like the bathroom. In dry summer conditions or if the room is well ventilated, the plant should be watered every two days at a minimum. The key here is to know how much water is available to the plant from the environment and bathroomlilies often get overwatered. If you notice your peace lily looks in ill health it is likely as a result of watering, so re-adjust your watering to rectify the problem. Pruning Peace Lilies Another reason that peace lilies die is because people prune them to cut them back or to try and encourage new growth. Peace lilies don't need pruning, if a part of the plant dies it will fall off and the plant will concentrate on repairing itself. When pruned, this will be too much work for the peace lily to cope with and it often will outright kill your plant. Peace Lily Flowering Peace lilies will flower in the spring and will stay in bloom until the middle of summer. Peace lilies are evergreen plants so they will always provide colour and won't drop their leaves. If you notice your peace lily has dropped a leaf or two, it is likely because they had died or become inefficient, and the plant will be growing new leaves. Position in the Home The best place to keep a peace lily is either in the bathroom or in a room that is frequented by people such as a living room. This is because peace lilies love humidity and both people and bathroom equipment cause lots of humidity. It is best not to leave peace lilies by external doors or windows because the plants don't do well in exposed conditions. Peace Lily Troubleshooting If you have followed the abovementioned tips, you should be able to avoid any peace lily heartbreaks. But if you do find your plant in poor health or if you're wondering what peace lily poor health looks like, then this list breaks down what to look for. Peace Lily Wilting Remember earlier we mentioned overwatering? Well, this is what is likely to be causing your wilting. The roots become overwhelmed by the amount of water and rot, which in turn causes the lily to wilt. The only way to stop death is to stop watering and hope the lily recovers, but wilting could be too far and the plant could be unsavable. Leaf Drying/Discoloration This is normally caused by being burnt by direct sunlight or the conditions in the home being too dry. Move the peace lily to a shaded part of the bathroom and it should get better. Pests Lastly, houseplants are prone to bugs and mites that take up residence on the lily's leaves. A quick check can diagnose if this is an issue. If you find mites or bugs, then wipe your leaves down thoroughly and then check the plant every few days. Pests are likely to have been carried in by other houseplants, so if you get rid of them, they shouldn't come back. And that's it, all you need to know to keep your peace lily healthy, and most of it is just not to try as hard. Simple."

         "Peace lilies are hugely popular houseplants that are super easy to grow. They feature glossy, emerald-green leaves that grow in very low light. In fact, the peace lily plant's ability to grow in offices and light-deprived homes has earned it the nickname “the closet plant.” However, when placed in bright, indirect light, peace lilies can produce elegant white flowers (a.k.a. spathes) almost year-round. This guide covers everything you need to know to grow and care for this tropical plant successfully. Peace Lily Overview Genus Name Spathiphyllum Common Name Peace Lily Additional Common Names Spathe Lily, White Sails Plant Type Houseplant Light Part Sun, Shade Height 1 to 3 feet Width 1 to 6 feet Flower Color Green, White Foliage Color Blue/Green Season Features Fall Bloom, Reblooming, Spring Bloom, Summer Bloom, Winter Bloom Special Features Good for Containers, Low Maintenance Propagation Division Where to Grow Peace Lily In the wild, peace lilies are tropical plants that thrive on the forest floor, so they love humid environments and dappled sunlight. Humid Spaces Rooms with higher humidity, such as bathrooms with a solar tube or skylight, or those near a north- or east-facing window, provide ideal conditions. Avoid placing your peace lily in direct sunlight because the harsh rays can burn the plant's leaves. If light options are limited in your home, a peace lily can still thrive in low-light conditions but it might not produce the pretty flower-like bracts. Avoid Drafts It is also best to avoid placing your peace lily near heat sources or drafts. Temperature fluctuations caused by fans, vents, air conditioners, open doors, fireplaces, radiators, and space heaters can cause the foliage to droop and wilt. Sheltered Outdoors Outdoors, peace lilies are only hardy in Zones 10-12. If you live in a warmer climate, you can plant mature, divided, or seedling peace lilies in the ground in late winter or early spring. Choose a spot with fertile soil and dappled sunlight (or partial shade) that provides shelter from strong winds. The leaves and flowers of peace lilies are considered toxic to humans.1 They are also toxic to cats and dogs.2Keep these plants away from pets and small children. How and When to Plant Peace Lily If you are planting a peace lily outside, dig a hole twice the size of the plant’s root ball. Place the plant in the hole, fill in the soil, and water thoroughly. You can also grow peace lilies in containers outdoors in these tropical climates. If you are growing a peace lily as a houseplant, you can plant it at any time, but many gardeners choose to plant or repot in the spring. Choose a container just slightly larger than the plant’s root ball. Fill the container two-thirds of the way with well-draining, peat-free houseplant potting soil or houseplant compost. Place your peace lily in the pot and hold it steady while you fill in the rest of the soil or compost. Water well. For a different look, peace lilies can grow in distilled, purified, or rain water alone. Choose a vessel or insert designed to suspend the plant above the waterline. Care Tips for Peace Lily Plant Caring for a peace lily is so simple, it is commonly recommended for first-time houseplant owners. Use these tips to keep your peace lily looking its best. Light Indoors or outdoors, peace lilies perform best in bright, indirect light. They can, however, do well in low-light conditions but will produce fewer spathe flowers and will have a slightly looser growth habit. A peace lily's shiny green foliage looks great even when the plant isn't blooming. To keep your foliage looking its best, wipe down the leaves with a damp cloth occasionally to keep dust from building up. Soil and Water Peace lilies need rich, well-draining potting mix to thrive—ideally with a soil pH between 5.8 and 6.5. They are prone to root rot in soggy or wet soil conditions. Err on the side of under-watering than overwatering with these plants. The amount of water your peace lily needs depends on the size of your container and the drainage capabilities of the soil. As a general guideline, water only when the top inch of the soil is dry and let your plants dry out a bit between waterings. Temperature and Humidity Peace lilies are tropical plants that prefer a warm, humid climate—ideally with a temperature between 65° and 80°F and a humidity level of 50% or higher. Temperatures below 40°F will damage the plant. To increase humidity levels for your peace lily, place a humidifier nearby. The Best Humidifier for Plants, Tested by BHG Fertilizer Give peace lilies an occasional dose of a slow-release fertilizer but don’t overdo it. Limit feedings to every 6 weeks throughout the spring and summer and watch for yellowing or browning in the leaves. Over-fertilization makes peace lilies prone to leaf burn. If you are growing a peace lily plant in water alone, add some liquid fertilizer to the water every 4 to 6 weeks to make up for the loss of soil nutrients. The 9 Best Fertilizers for Indoor Plants, Reviewed by BHG Pruning Peace lilies benefit from regular pruning and deadheading (every six months or as needed). After a stalk has produced a “flower,” it will not produce another one and will eventually turn brown and die. Cut back spent stalks at the base of the plant to make room for new stalks. Then, trim away yellow or shriveled leaves and spathe flowers with scissors or pruning shears. Potting and Repotting Peace lilies like to be a little pot-bound, so plan to repot yours only when you see roots starting to poke out from the bottom of the pot. When you do repot your peace lily, try to remove as much of the old soil as you can and only increase the pot by an inch or two in diameter. Pests and Problems Peace lilies don’t have many issues with pests, but those attracted to moist microclimates can be problematic. If you see evidence of mealybugs, fungus gnats, thrips, scale, and spider mites, it’s best to address them quickly. Allow the soil of your peace lily to dry out a little more between waterings and use an insecticidal soap or neem oil to eradicate the pests. Root rot is another common issue for peace lilies—especially when they are overwatered. It causes yellowing and wilting in the lower foliage as well as brown spots on the leaves and (depending on the type of rot) also on the stalks. Terra-cotta pots absorb excess moisture, helping to prevent root rot. Leaf blight is another issue that is exacerbated by high humidity levels and moist soil conditions. It can create brown or black lesions on the leaves that appear wet and mushy. If you catch it early, you can curtail the disease by removing the affected leaves and repotting the plant in fresh soil and a sterilized pot. The 7 Best Potting Soils How to Propagate Peace Lily The simplest way to propagate peace lilies is via division. Spring is the best time to do this, but if your plant is becoming overly pot-bound, any time will do. Each time you divide a plant, you will need to wait until it has reached maturity and is large enough to separate into multiple sections. To divide your peace lily plant, gently remove the plant from its pot and pry apart the stems into 2 or 3 clumps (making sure each clump has its own set of roots). Replant each of the new divisions in a separate container as you would a new plant. Types of Peace Lily Peace lilies come in different sizes, and a few offer variegated leaves. Here are a few examples. Wallis Peace Lily The most common type of peace lily is Spathiphyllum wallisii, which features large glossy, green leaves and white, calla-like blooms. It can reach up to 3 feet tall indoors. 'Domino' Peace Lily This variety of Spathiphyllum wallisii is a form with variegated foliage. It also blooms, but its main attraction is its green foliage speckled with cream and white. 'Jetty' Peace Lily 'Jetty' is a fast-growing, lush variety of Spathiphyllum with loads of white spathe flowers. 'Mauna Loa' Peace Lily 'Mauna Loa' is a vigorous variety of Spathiphyllum wallisii that grows to 3 feet tall with pure white blooms. 'Sensation' Peace Lily This variety of Spathiphyllum wallisii is a giant among peace lilies, growing up to 6 feet tall, with proportionately large flower bracts. Frequently Asked Questions Why are my peace lily flowers turning green? We call them flowers, but the blooms on peace lilies are technically spathes. The large, white spathe of the peace lily is a modified leaf (called a bract). It protects the spadix, which is the spike of small flowers held upright in the center of the spathe. As these flowers age, the spathe fades to green. However, since the peace lily has little need for fertilizer, the bracts can also turn green when overfed. Is a peace lily related to true lilies? Native to the tropical regions of South America, the peace lily is not actually a true lily. It's a member of the Araceae family—which includes other houseplant favorites like pothos, philodendron, and monstera. Do peace lilies purify the air? Yes and no. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) did a study in the late 1980s3 that indicated that certain plants (like the peace lily) could absorb environmental contaminants such as carbon monoxide and formaldehyde from indoor air. However, that study was conducted in conditions that mimic a sealed spacecraft, not a home. Also, later studies4 have shown that you would need as many as 10 plants per square foot to create a significant filtering effect. In a 1,500-square-foot home, that would be 15,000 plants!"

         "Pothos Plant Features A perfect houseplant for beginners, pothos is one of the easiest you can grow -- and one of the most popular. For many people it's their first houseplant, and often remains their favorite. It's forgiving in its care needs, so you can enjoy it in virtually any room of your home or office, even those interiors that receive only artificial light. Pothos is practically effortless to display. You can grow it in hanging baskets to trail down, let it climb a totem or trellis, or grow horizontally along a tabletop or mantle. The most common form, golden pothos, features dark green leaves splashed and marbled in shades of yellow, cream, or white. It's also one of the fastest-growing varieties. Newer selections (see them at the bottom of this page) show off different variegation patterns, from the green-on-green look of Global Green to the silvery sheen on Cebu Blue. Pothos plants, as they grow and mature, develop larger leaves. While young, immature plants may feature leaves that grow only 3 or 4 inches long, the foliage can be come much larger. Encourage pothos plants to develop larger leaves by giving them bright light, warm temperatures, and letting them grow vertically. Note: Some varieties, including Baltic Blue and Cebu Blue, will develop dramatic cuts, called fenestrations, in the leaves. This makes them look similar to a monstera. Note: Pothos is a common name for the plant. It's botanically known as Epipremnum, though throughout history, it's been reclassified as a Scindapsus, Rhaphidophora, and Pothos. (Botanically, Pothos species are distant cousins of the Epipremnum varieties we enjoy indoors.) But no matter what you call it, this plant is a delightful houseplant! Pothos Questions?

Check out our retailer partners. Pothos Growing Instructions Pothos requires no special care indoors; it tolerates low light (but grows well in medium- and high-light spots, as well), low humidity, and the occasional missed watering. That said, pothos prefers moist (but not wet or saturated) soil, so it's best to water it when the top couple of inches or so of the potting mix is dry. Because it's such an easy-care houseplant, you don't need to worry about fertilizing pothos a lot. Feed it at least twice a year (every six months or so) with a general-purpose houseplant fertilizer (available from your local garden center). If you wish to fertilize the plant more frequently, you can certainly do so to encourage faster growth. If your pothos grows longer than you'd like, or becomes too lanky, it's easy to trim. Just prune off several inches from the end of a stem. Doing so will encourage it to develop sideshoots, becoming more full and lush. You can prune pothos any time of the year without harming it. When pruning, avoid removing more than about one third of the total leaves at one time. Pruning too hard can cause stress to your pothos. Looking for other low-water houseplants? Here are some of our top picks. This easy-care houseplant is not intended for human or animal consumption. In some subtropical areas, it can be considered an invasive pest. Check local restrictions before growing it outdoors.

Arrowhead Plant Arrowhead plant and pothos make a delightful climbing combo! Ponytail Palm Ponytail palm and pothos are perfect, easy-care houseplants to grow together. Q&A My 'Marble Queen' pothos started growing leaves that are all green instead of variegated. Is this normal? All variegated plants -- including 'Marble Queen' pothos -- have the ability to revert to their non-variegated forms. This is a natural occurrence that can happen at any time. Happily, it's nothing to worry about and easy to fix. Just prune out the reverted shoot on your pothos (that way it doesn't take over the entire plant). If you wish to plant it in another pot, you can grow it out or share it with a gardening friend. I've been told pothos likes to be rootbound. How do I know when to repot it? While pothos tolerates being rootbound, or having more than 75 percent of the volume of the pot filled with roots, it doesn't actually enjoy it. You'll find your pothos will grow faster and more happily if you repot as the roots begin to fill the container. When repotting, it's ideal to jump up one pot size at a time -- if you go from a small pot to a large pot, all the extra potting mix around the roots may hold moisture longer than your pothos prefers, causing roots to suffocate, die, and rot."

         "Information Pothos Common names: Pothos, Devil’s ivy, Ceylon creeper, golden pothos, silver vine Botanical name: Epipremnum, Scindapsus, Philodendron Family: Arum (Araceae) Type: Evergreen climber Height: 2 to 20m (7 to 65ft) Aspect: Bright, indirect light Moisture level: Average to high humidity Room temperature: 12 to 26°C (56 to 80°F) Hardiness: H1B Difficulty: Easy to average In the world of houseplants, the name ‘pothos’ refers to several climbing plants, but here we’re mainly talking about Epipremnum aureum. Commonly known as golden pothos, it is a self-clinging evergreen vine, with glossy bright-green ovate leaves that are splashed with cream or gold. Although it hails from just one island (Mo’orea, one of the Society Islands in the Pacific), it has naturalised in forests around the world, including in Australia, South Africa, and the West Indies. After taking root on the forest floor, it pulls itself up trees using self-clinging aerial roots. In some places (such as Sri Lanka), it has made a devastating nuisance of itself, so it should never be planted outside in warm regions where it isn’t native and may run amok. But, as a climbing houseplant, it is superb, being difficult to kill and having been shown to rid the air of harmful indoor pollutants (such as formaldehyde, xylene, and benzene). In the right conditions, it can form columns of greenery and even coat walls in curtains of lush leaves. Where is the best place to put a pothos? Bright indirect light is best for the healthiest, most enthusiastic growth, with large leaves, strong colour, and distinct variegation. Strong direct sun could scorch the leaves. Pothos is known as devil’s ivy because it remains green in deep shade; however, although it will tolerate very low light, growth will be slow, the leaves will remain small, and variegated forms could revert to the colour of the parent species. The ‘pothos’ that perform best in low, indirect light are the Philodendron varieties. Good air circulation is great, but keep the plant well away from draughts, as well as radiators and dehumidifiers. Humidity is preferable, but not necessary. They will perform best in the room temperatures that we feel comfortable in, but their toleration range is 12 to 26°. How to make pothos leaves huge Pothos are climbing plants that pull themselves up trees in the wild. When they are given a structure to climb – as well as the right care and conditions – their leaves can grow very big (up to 90cm). When the plant is young, usually the best option is to plunge a coir pole into the pot. Despite being self-clinging vines, pothos usually need help by being regularly tied in. Once the plant is a good size, it can be tricky to remove it from its original support – in which case, repot it, providing a second structure to climb, alongside the existing nursery pole. This can be anything sturdy: if you want a frame, consider a wall trellis or, in a large room, ornate salvaged iron gates or doors; if you prefer one central support, a metal obelisk is ideal or a salvaged pillar, post, or column could provide a beautiful floor to ceiling column. Do pothos prefer to climb or hang? Pothos look beautiful trailing from a container hung from the ceiling or sat atop a high shelf or cabinet. However, their leaves won’t be as big if they can’t climb. A combination of climbing and trailing looks fabulous, once the plant reaches a certain size. In Brighton, houseplant enthusiast Asha Kirkby sent her 14-year-old pothos climbing to the ceiling of her living room and then employed a system of hooks and string to support the plant around the tops of the walls, just under the cornice. ‘It grows all around the room – stretching 16 metres, but the stems cascade down intermittently from the main growth, so the plant is longer than that,’ she says. ‘I stuck large hooks into the wall, near the high ceiling, at 1.5 metre intervals, and then tied her to the hooks using strong garden twine. The new ends of the plant need threading through every 1 to 2 months.’ How often to water a pothos Water when the upper half of the compost is dry (usually every 1 to 2 weeks in summer); if the pot feels relatively light when lifted or the leaves begin to droop, it needs a drink. When watered, the compost should be thoroughly moist, but let the excess water drain out after watering; don’t leave the plant sitting in a tray of water for long periods. Overwatering is the worst thing you can do to a pothos: waterlogging could lead to poor growth, rotting, or susceptibility to pests (such as spider mite and mealybugs). They will tolerate drought, but prefer to be watered when necessary. A lot less watering is required during winter. Philodendron forms of ‘pothos’ tend to need a bit more watering than Epipremnum and Scindapsus. Should you mist a pothos? Because golden pothos grows in wet tropical forest in the wild, it loves the moist air of a bathroom or kitchen. It is incredibly resilient, so it will tolerate rooms with low to average humidity, but it’s best to boost humidity in those places, either by sitting the plant on a tray of pebbles and water or by regularly misting it. If your pothos is growing up a coir pole, you could also spray that with water. What is the best way to grow a pothos? Feed it Fertilise with nitrogen-rich liquid food once a fortnight during spring and summer. Without sufficient food, growth won’t be as vigorous, the leaves won’t be as big, and variegated plants could revert to the form of their parent species. Once a year, remove the upper layer of compost, and replace with fresh peat-free compost. Prune it Cut the plant back to boost bushiness if it has become too leggy for your liking; a regular trim at any time of year will help to maintain lush, healthy growth, although spring and summer are the optimum seasons to do it. The closer to the base of the plant you cut, the bushier it will grow back. Volumise it If the plant looks thin and leggy, prune it (as above) or pin a few sections up at the base. Use plant, floristry, or hair pins to attach the node (lumpy protrusion) of a long section up onto the compost; this immediately creates a fuller looking plant, and the pinned sections will produce roots. Repot it Since pothos really enjoy being a little pot-bound, only transfer into a bigger container when absolutely necessary. Use multipurpose peat-free compost mixed with coir or moss. Variegation If your variegated pothos has started to revert back to the colour of its parent species, cut out the reverted growth; move the plant to a position that has bright indirect light and feed it regularly. Propagation New plants are easy to make via stem cuttings taken in spring or summer. Cut a length of trail and then section it into the pieces you need, using a sharp, clean pair of secateurs. Cut a few centimetres above and below a node (the lumpy bit on the stem, close to a leaf), so that you are left with a node and a leaf. Cut the upper end horizontal and the lower end at an angle, so you remember which is which. Then insert 10 to 20 of these little cuttings into the same pot of moist compost, plunging the lower ends (cut at an angle) in. If you only use a few, you won’t produce a generous, bushy plant. Keep the compost moist (but never waterlogged) for the first month; then revert to the scant watering that mature pothos enjoy. It’s also worth boosting the humidity for the first month (by misting, sitting the pot on a tray of pebbles and water, or placing it in a bright bathroom), but once they are established, such humidity is not necessary. Safety Pothos is toxic to dogs and cats. It is also mildly toxic to humans, so be careful if you have young children, and wear gloves and long sleeves when handling the plant to prevent skin irritation. What is a pothos? Although Epipremnum aureum may take centre stage, other plants are included under the umbrella term ‘pothos’. They are mainly Epipremnum pinnatum (the money plant), Scindapsus pictus (silver vine), and Philodendron hederaceum (syn. Philodendron scandens; heart leaf). It all gets rather incestuous and confusing because Epipremnum pinnatum used to be known as Philodendron epipremnum, and Epipremnum aureum used to be classed as Scindapsus aureus and, before that, was originally labelled Pothos aureus – which is why it is still referred to as ‘pothos’ today, even though Pothos is in fact a different genus. Retailers offer a plethora of varieties stemming from these four species and, while they vary ever so slightly in shape, colour, patterning, and texture, they look very similar and their growing requirements are identical, so they are all referred to as pothos. If you pick up a trailing plant with large heart-shaped leaves in a houseplant shop, it’s probably a pothos. Which pothos to grow The principal species, Epipremnum aureum, has smooth, glossy green ovate leaves marbled with gold or cream. But there are many varieties of pothos available with wonderful foliage colours and markings. Scindapsus pictus ‘Argyraeus’ produces neat fir-green leaves with grey blotches; Scindapsus pictus ‘Trebie’ enchanting silver leaves are marked green; Epipremnum aureum ‘Njoy’ is a striking green and cream-white; Epipremnum aureum ‘Neon’ is a cheering shade of golden lime; Epipremnum pinnatum Marble Planet has rough-textured emerald leaves; and Epipremnum aureum ‘Global Green’ is a lush combination of dark green and apple green. Most have an ovate heart leaf shape, but some (such as glaucous Epipremnum pinnatum ‘Cebu Blue’) are markedly more lanceolate. Philodendron leaves are thinner, smoother, and have more of a distinct heart shape, with a pointed tip, and, when variegated, the colouring tends to be more defined and distinct. Also new growth on a Philodendron can be pinkish or reddish, and they tend to be leggier. Philodendron ‘Lemon Lime’ is a vivid shade of green yellow, and Philodendron hederaceum ‘Brasil’ has two-tone green and lime leaves. When shopping, always choose a bushy, healthy-looking plant that has lots of base stems (ideally, 10 or more) emerging from the compost."

         "Aechmea Fasciata: Urn Plant, Vase Plant Care Tips Are you ready to add a touch of tropical pizazz to your indoor garden? Look no further than the stunning Aechmea fasciata, which may soon become your favorite bromeliad. These plant care tips will help keep yours healthy and looking good. Bromeliads have rocked my world for many years, so I share the love today. The Aechmea fasciata, with its patterned silver foliage and pink flower, makes a great houseplant and will have beginning gardeners singing “green thumb” in no time. I started my horticultural career as an interior landscape technician, maintaining plants in lobbies, malls, offices, and hotels. Granted, these aren’t the most welcoming environments for flowering plants native to the tropics and the subtropics, but bromeliads held their own. This Aechmea was commonly used, and their pink blooms were long-lasting. Botanical Name: Aechmea fasciata Common Names: Vase Plant, Silver Vase Plant, Urn PlantAechmea Fasciata Plant Care Tips Two aechmea bromeliad plants with pink flowers sit side by side. The silvery patterned foliage makes this plant distinctive. Looking at the plant on the left, you can see inside the central tank that collects water. It’s also called a vase, urn, or cup. Light Requirements Aechmea plants like bright light, near an east or west window is good. They need this exposure to bring out the variegation in their foliage and to have the small flowers open up. Keep them out of hot windows to avoid prolonged exposure to direct sun because they’ll burn. They’ll do okay in lower light for a few weeks, but to grow them for the long haul and have them produce pups (baby plants), bright indirect light is key. Watering Aechmeas are epiphytes and in nature, grow attached to other plants and even rocks. The roots are primarily for anchoring. They get the moisture and nutrients they need through their foliage. Never keep them soggy or let them sit directly in water, as this leads to root rot. It’s best to keep the vase, cup, urn, or tank (the center where the flower arises out) 1/4 full of water. Flush it out with fresh water every 1-2 months to avoid any build-up of bacteria. I’ve found that the center of the plant will begin to rot over time if it’s kept full, especially in the winter months. Keep even less water in the central cup if you have low light and/or cool temperatures. I let the cup dry for two to seven days before refilling it with a little water. My situation is a bit different: I live in the Arizona desert and in the low-humidity months (there are quite a few!) I keep the tank about half full. If you have hard water, consider using purified or distilled water. I use filtered water for all my indoor plants. I have a tankless R/O water filtration system that runs through my kitchen faucet; it has a re-mineralization cartridge that puts the good minerals back in. Because moisture is collected through their leaves, Aechmeas appreciate spraying or misting once or twice a week. I’ve had this sprayer for over three years, and it still works like a charm. I water the growing medium every 1-2 months, depending on the temperatures and the season. Like all houseplants, you want to water less in the late fall through winter. An aechmea bromelaid plant with a large pink flower & a guzmania bromeliad plant sit side by side. My Aechmea next to a Neoregelia, another fine type of bromeliad. Humidity/Temperature As I say about all houseplants, if your house is comfortable temperature-wise for you, then your Aechema will do just fine. You want to avoid putting it in any areas with cold or hot drafts. Bromeliads are native to the subtropics and the tropics (locations with high humidity) but handle the lack of humidity in our homes and offices just fine. I have this humidity meter in my dining room. It’s inexpensive but does the trick and still works fine after a few years. I run my Canopy humidifiers when the humidity reads low, often in the Arizona desert! Feeding/Fertilizing Aechmeas, like other bromeliads, get their nutrients from matter that falls on them from plants growing above. The roots serve the purpose of anchoring them onto whatever they’re growing on – trees, rocks, etc. For this reason, it’s best to spray the fertilizer onto the foliage and the growing medium’s surface. I don’t feed bromeliads because I feel they really don’t need it. If your Aechmea does, use an all-purpose orchid food, diluted to 1/2 strength, or a bromeliad fertilizer. Just be sure not to get too much in the tank because the salts in the fertilizer build up and cause burn. Feed in the spring or summer, once or twice a year. Growing Mix Aechmeas are epiphytes, so they need a mix that drains very well. They’ll grow fine in orchid bark or orchid mix. I’ve also planted them in 1/2 coco chips and 1/2 coco coir, a more sustainable replacement for peat moss. Repotting Aechmeas don’t have extensive root systems, so yours most likely will never need to be repotted. If you need to, spring, summer, and early fall are the best times. You may choose to repot the pups at some point – more on that below. Propagation/Aechmea Pups The mother plant eventually dies after flowering (sad but true), which is part of their life cycle. Pups or babies (new plants) will appear at the mother’s base, so a part of her lives on. Happy ending! Those pups are one way to propagate Aechmeas. You can cut away the foliage of the mother plant after it’s completely dried and dead, leaving the pups to grow in that same pot. Or, you can carefully remove the pups after reaching 4-6″ and put them in a new pot. Another option is to mount them on driftwood or bark. It can take a bromeliad pup 3-5 years to flower. So, don’t expect it to happen the next year! The other way to propagate bromeliads is by seed. Close up of the urn vase or cup of an aechmea bromeliad plant with a pink flower. Here’s a close-up so you can see the small violet flower buds coming off the stalk. Safe For Pets I haven’t heard anything about these being toxic to cats or dogs. According to the ASPCA, Guzmania plants (a bromeliad relative) are considered non-toxic for cats and dogs. However, some kitties like to chew on their crunchy leaves, so if yours does, you might want to keep your eye on that. It won’t poison them, but it could make them sick. The Guzmania is a popular bromeliad sold in places like Trader Joe’s, Home Depot, Lowes, etc. Get Guzmanina care & growing tips here. Aechmea Flower The large stalk with pink bracts produces small violet flowers. You can see them in the photo above. When buying an Aechmea, I look inside to ensure the violet flowers aren’t open. If the flowers are fully open, yours won’t last as long. The colorful flower head should last and look good for up to 4 months. After it dies, cut it off down to the tank’s base. Once yours has flowered, the mother plant eventually dies. You can read more on bromeliad flowers here.\nUrn plant, also known as silver vase, is an epiphytic plant known for its elegantly arcing leaves striped with silvery gray and its showy pink bract, which resembles a large flower. However, this bract actually holds many small purple, red, or blue flowers that will appear at the height of the plant's bloom. This member of the bromeliad family is native to the warm, humid climate of Brazil but makes an excellent indoor plant in temperate regions. Urn plant grows best with partial sunlight, moist but well-drained soil, and temperatures between 60°F and 85°F. Here's how to care for urn plants in your home. Common Name: Urn plant, silver vase Botanical Name: Aechmea fasciata Family: Bromeliaceae Plant Type: Epiphyte Mature Size: 1-3 ft. tall and wide Sun Exposure: Partial Soil Type: Moist, well-drained Soil pH: Acid, Alkaline, Neutral Bloom Time: Blooms once; timing varies Flower Color: Pink bract with blue, purple, or red flowers Hardiness Zones: 10-11 (USDA) Native Area: Brazil Urn Plant Care Put in a place with bright, indirect light. Plant in moist, well-drained potting mix. Keep the soil consistently moist and water the center cup. Feed monthly during the growing season. Want more gardening tips? Sign up for our free gardening newsletter for our best-growing tips, troubleshooting hacks, and more! Light Give your urn plant plenty of bright, indirect light. This plant naturally grows below the tree canopy's shade in its native tropical forests. Keep the plant out of direct sun. Soil Use a light, well-drained potting mix that holds moisture. Since urn plant is an epiphytic plant, it uses its roots to hold onto tree branches rather than growing in soil. You can purchase pre-made mixes designed for bromeliads or make your own by combining equal parts peat moss or coconut coir, perlite, and finely shredded pine bark or orchid bark. Water Allow your urn plant's soil to dry out before each watering. Instead of watering on a regular schedule, check soil moisture often and water based on that. However, it's important to keep the central cup-shaped opening formed by the plant's leaves at least half full of water at all times. Flush and replace the water every few weeks. Temperature and Humidity Urn plant grows best in conditions with temperatures between 60°F and 80°F and humidity between 40 and 50 percent. Plants can tolerate higher temperatures with adequate water and humidity. Fertilizer Urn plant doesn't necessarily require fertilizer, but you can use a balanced liquid houseplant fertilizer diluted to half strength when watering its roots during the spring and summer. Take care not to add fertilizer to the water you pour into the central cup. Some gardeners choose to use fertilizers designed for orchids or air plants. Propagating Urn Plant Urn plant can only be propagated when offsets, or baby plants, appear once a mature plant has bloomed. Offsets will grow around the base of the mother plant after the inflorescence has appeared. You can remove them to propagate separately or simply leave the offsets in place as the mother plant dies back. If you decide to divide the offsets, let them grow as large as possible before removing them so they have the best chance of surviving independently. Gather a clean, sharp knife or shears, rooting hormone powder, fresh potting mix, and a small plant pot for each offset. Examine the mother plant and clear away an inch or two of soil around the base. You should be able to see where the pups connect to the main stem slightly below the soil surface. Use the knife to remove the offset, cutting straight down at the base and getting as close to the mother plant as possible. It's okay if the cutting hasn't yet developed any roots of its own. Fill a plant pot with fresh potting mix and water lightly to moisten it. Make a hole a few inches deep in the soil with your finger. Dip the base of the offset in rooting hormone and plant it in the hole, only pressing down the soil lightly to keep the cutting in place. Put the cutting in a warm place that gets bright, indirect light. Keep the soil evenly moist and the central cup filled with water. Common Pests & Plant Diseases Urn plant isn't particularly susceptible to pests or diseases, but it can fall prey to common sucking insects like mealybugs and scale. Root rot, a fungal issue caused by overly wet soil, may affect plants that aren't allowed to dry out between waterings. How to Get Urn Plant to Bloom An urn plant that isn't blooming may simply be immature. Generally, plants must be at least three years old before they bloom, and they must be grown under the proper conditions. A mature plant may not bloom if temperatures are too consistent. The plant needs cooler temperatures to grow dormant, after which it may produce an inflorescence. In the winter, keep the plant in a cool place and cut back on watering. You can also try stimulating your urn plant to bloom by emptying the central cup and placing the plant in an airtight, clear plastic bag with an apple for about a week. You may be more likely to see the inflorescence appear in the two to three months after removing the bag. Common Problems With Urn Plant Flower Not Reblooming An urn plant's colorful inflorescence can last for weeks or months. However, these plants only bloom once in their lifetime. Once the inflorescence dies back, it won't regrow. For future blooms, follow the instructions above to propagate offsets into new plants. Leaves Turning Yellow Yellow leaves are a common sign of overwatering your urn plant. A plant that's not getting enough light may also display yellow leaves. Browning Tips Overly dry conditions can cause the tips of your urn plant's leaves to brown. Too much direct sunlight can also cause brown spots on leaves. FAQ How tall do urn plants grow? Urn plants can grow between one and three feet tall. How often do urn plants bloom? Urn plants will only bloom once in their lifetime. Can urn plant grow indoors? Yes, urn plant makes an excellent houseplant with the proper care and conditions.\nUrn Plant Care: How To Grow Urn Plant Houseplants Aechmea fasciata, the urn plant bromeliad, comes to us from the South American rainforests. It is an epiphyte, commonly called an air plant, and in the wild it grows on other plants where it receives moisture from heavy rains and nutrients from decaying debris around its roots. This is important to urn plant care in your home as you will try to mimic its natural conditions. Tips for Urn Plant Care In the rainforests, rainwater gathers in the stiff rosette of leaves that form the urn. Plant care in the home consists of keeping the center filled with water at all times. For a healthy plant, the water should be emptied and refilled once a week to prevent stagnation. Watch out for dry brown edges of the leaves. It's a sign of dehydration in your urn plant. Care should also be taken with the soil. Keep it moist, but don't overwater. Soggy soil will cause rot at the base of your urn plant bromeliad. You can fertilize your urn plant bromeliad by misting with a weak foliar spray or by adding a half strength solution to the water at its center once a month. If you live in a hardiness zone of 10b or 11, you can grow urn plants outside as long as you keep them well watered. They aren't fussy about soil when grown outdoors, but caring for an urn plant indoor is a bit different. Once again, look at how they grow in the wild. Silt, decaying debris and bits of leaf and bark cling to and build up around the roots of the epiphyte. In your chosen pot at home, you should try to duplicate this soft, well aerated soil. Orchid potting mix is ideal for this or, if you prefer to mix your own, mix peat moss, perlite, and finely shredded pine bark in equal parts. You need a soil that remains light and well aerated so the roots can easily spread. Urn plants prefer bright light, but not direct sun and can suffer scorched leaves if moved too quickly from indoors to out during the summer months. They do best in temperatures between 65 and 75 degrees F. (12-24 C.), although they can tolerate higher with regular misting. How to Get an Urn Plant to Bloom Almost everyone who tries to grow urn plants wants them to bloom. Those colorful, long lasting bracts rising from the center of the plant are the ultimate reward in caring for an urn plant. A plant must be at least three years old before it produces a flower stem. One of the most common complaints of gardeners is the failure of bracts to grow. Urn plants need good light and plenty of it for bract production. If light isn't the problem, then it may be a lack of ethylene gas. To encourage blooming, try placing a quartered apple on top of the soil and using a plastic bag to cover both pot and urn plant. Bromeliad plants bloom only once before they die, but don't despair. They leave several lovely gifts behind. Once the bract turns brown, continue caring for your urn plant as before even as the leaves turn brown and die. Beneath the dying leaves you'll find two or more \"pups\"--baby urn plants. Allow these pups to grow in place until they are 6 inches (15 cm.) tall which usually takes five or six months, and then transfer them to pots of their own.\nAechmea fasciata: Growing Guidelines This article provides information on the specific growing guidelines for Aechmea fasciata bromeliads. Light: Bright light from an east or west window. Temperature: In summer, plants enjoy moving outdoors, provided temperatures range between 70 to 85 degrees F (21 to 30 degrees C). In the fall, winter and early spring, average room temperature should be between 65 to 75 degrees F (18 to 24 degrees C). Fertilizer: In the summer, feed monthly with a liquid plant food diluted to half the normal strength. Spray it on the leaves and fertilize the roots. In the winter, feed plants every other month. Water: Flush the water in the reservoir regularly, at least every 10 days. Lightly water the roots weekly in the summer, and less often in the winter. Do not allow the roots to dry out completely in any season. Soil: Orchid potting soil or a bromeliad mix work great! For more information on soil, take a look at this bromeliad soil article. Repotting: Repot young plants annually in the spring, as needed, until they fill an 8-inch pot. Longevity: Plants mature in 3 to 4 years. Propagation: Divide and repot offsets when they are 4 to 6 months old and at least 6 in (15 cm) tall. For more information on bromeliad propagation, get our free Guide to Bromeliad Pups. Selections: In addition to the green-leafed form, ‘Purpurea’ features leaves blushed with maroon, and ‘Variegata’ has creamy longitudinal stripes on the leaves. Display Tips: Grow Aechmea fasciata in its own pot near plants with lush green foliage, such as ferns or flowering houseplants that need abundant light. Young pups can be mounted on a piece of wood for one season."

         "Air plants (Tillandsia spp) are unique and fascinating plants that have gained popularity in recent years due to their low-maintenance requirements and ability to grow without soil. As part of the Bromeliad family, air plants are related to pineapples. Contrary to their name, air plants do not actually float in the air but rather attach themselves to other plants or objects using their roots. They are known as epiphytes and absorb nutrients and moisture from the air and rain. How to grow air plants Grow air plants in bright but indirect light, such as near a window. They can tolerate some direct sunlight, but too much can cause their leaves to burn. Ad Air plants require temperatures between 10-32°C and moderate humidity levels, around 40-60 percent, making them ideal for growing in terrariums and bathrooms. Where to grow air plants Air plant terrarium Air plant terrarium Air plants can be grown in various rooms in your home, particularly those with higher levels of humidity such as the kitchen or bathroom. They can be displayed in creative ways, such as in glass terrariums, hanging planters, or mounted on to driftwood, tree branches, bricks, or stones. In the UK, air plants can be moved outdoors in summer but should be brought indoors in early autumn, as they struggle with temperatures below 12ºC. More like this How to care for air plants Dunking an air plant in water Dunking an air plant in water Watering is an essential aspect of caring for air plants. Since they do not grow in soil, they rely on air and rain for their water and nutrient needs. Air plants therefore need regular misting to keep them hydrated. In a bathroom it's likely your air plants will receive sufficient moisture just from the mist generated from regular showering. However, in rooms with lower humidity, you will need to water them. Watering methods for air plants include misting, soaking, or dunking. Misting involves spraying water onto the leaves using a plant mister. Soaking involves immersing the entire plant in water for about 20-30 minutes. Dunking involves quickly submerging the plant in water and then removing it. The frequency of watering depends on various factors, such as the species, the environmental conditions, and the time of year. In general, air plants should be watered every one to two weeks. In addition to watering, air plants also benefit from regular fertilisation. They can be fed with a diluted liquid fertiliser specifically formulated for air plants or bromeliads, which can simply be applied to the water you're spraying onto the leaves or dunking the plant into. It's a good idea to fertilise air plants once a month in spring and summer. Follow the instructions on the fertiliser package for the correct dilution rate and application method. Air plants also require some general maintenance. Gently shake or tap them after watering to remove excess water from the leaves and prevent rot. Remove any dead or yellowing leaves by gently pulling them off from the base of the plant. Trimming the roots is not necessary, as they serve as anchors rather than absorbing nutrients. How to propagate air plants Removing dead stems from Spanish moss Removing dead stems from Spanish moss Air plants naturally produce offsets, also known as 'pups', which can be propagated to grow new plants. Pups are smaller versions of the parent plant that grow at the base of the plant, and eventually develop their own root system. To propagate air plants, gently twist or wiggle the pup until it detaches from the parent plant. Avoid pulling or cutting it off, as this can cause damage. Once the pup has been separated, you can either let it grow on its own or replant it in a separate location. To replant the pup, you can place it on a suitable surface, such as a piece of bark or driftwood, and secure it with a non-toxic adhesive or string until it establishes its own root system. Place the pup in bright, indirect light and water it regularly as you would with a mature air plant. Pests and diseases Air plants are relatively pest-resistant, but they can occasionally be affected by common pests such as mealybugs and scale insects – more likely if grown outside in summer. Isolate any affected plants to prevent the infestation from spreading to other plants, particularly if you're bringing them back indoors in autumn. Outside, scale insect and mealy bug are usually dealt with naturally by predators such as birds and ladybirds. Indoors, try manually removing the insects from the leaves by hand. Buying advice for air plants Always choose healthy plants from reputable sources to ensure their quality and longevity Look for specimens with vibrant-looking leaves and no signs of pests or diseases Avoid plants with brown or wilted leaves, mushy or black roots, or any visible signs of infestation Several reputable online retailers in the UK offer a wide variety of air plants for purchase. Some also stock containers and other air plant paraphernalia\nIf you're looking to start growing house plants or adding a unique one to your collection, try an air plant. Since they do not require soil to grow, indoor air plants for beginners can be satisfying and easy; they are known for being low-maintenance and fun to display around your home. While the term “air plant” is most commonly associated with plants in the Tillandsia genus, there are actually hundreds of different types of air plants that span multiple different plant families. Learn how to keep these tropical plants happy indoors. What Is an Air Plant? The term “air plant” is used to refer to plants that do not require soil to survive, but instead grow on top of other plants, such as trees, without being parasitic. Rather than getting their nutrients from the soil, air plants derive their nutrients from the air, water, and debris around them. The term “air plant” is synonymous with the Greek term “epiphyte,” which is translated to “on top of plant” (epi = on top of; phyte = plant). Common Name Air plant Botanical Name Tillandsia Family Bromeliaceae Plant Type Epiphytes Mature Size 2-12 in. tall (indoors), 5-7 ft. (outdoors) Sun Exposure Partial Bloom Time Dependent on type Flower Color Red, pink, blue, purple, yellow, white Hardiness Zones 9-13 (USDA) Native Areas North America, South America Overhead view of Tillandsia air plants being watered by soaking.

Give them bright indirect light. Avoid lengthy periods of direct light as it will scorch their leaves. Water, mist, or soak regularly. The type of air plant will determine which irrigation method is best. Make sure your air plant is in a warm and humid environment. Do not plant them in soil under any conditions. Light Since air plants are commonly found growing on trees and other large plants below the forest canopy, they are accustomed to receiving bright to medium indirect light. Avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight which can easily burn their delicate leaves. Soil The defining quality of air plants, or epiphytes, is that they do not require soil to survive. However, some air plants such as staghorn ferns, birds nest ferns, some species of moss, and some species of philodendron (among others) can adapt to grow in soil, although they require extremely arid, well-draining mixes to survive. Water Air plants require regular watering to thrive indoors. However, since these plants grow without soil, watering air plants can look a little bit different than watering your other houseplants. Most air plants are successfully watered using a soaking method, where the plant is left to soak in a bowl of distilled water for 20 to 40 minutes every 1 to 2 weeks. However, some air plants prefer regular misting, or a quick dunk versus a longer soak. Researching the specific type of air plant that you have will help to determine the best watering method and how often to water your air plant. Temperature and Humidity One of the most important parts of caring for air plants properly indoors is ensuring that they receive enough moisture and humidity. Air plants prefer warm, humid conditions to ensure that they do not dry out. Regular household temperatures are fine for air plants, just ensure that they are not exposed to any cold drafts or temperatures in the winter. When it comes to humidity, avoid placing your air plants near heating/cooling vents in your home, or rooms with particularly dry conditions. Your plant will thrive with a humidifier placed nearby, or you can grow them in notoriously humid rooms in your home such as the bathroom, laundry room, or kitchen. Fertilizer Air plants can be fed once or twice a month with a water-soluble fertilizer formulated especially for epiphytes, bromeliads, or air plants. Add to the water you spray or soak them in. These fertilizers contain absorbable nitrogen. A Tillandsia air plant in a glass terrarium against a white background. Credit: The Spruce / Cori Sears Displaying Your Air Plant Since these plants do not require soil, there are lots of fun and creative ways to display your air plant around your home. As long as you can move the plant to water it, feel free to get creative when it comes to displaying your air plant. Consider these ideas: Mount them on another medium such as a piece of driftwood, a rock, or a wood board. Place them in unusual areas where you can't put other plants, such as on walls, mirrors, and headboards. Display them as a focal piece in a decorative terrarium (best for mesic air plants that are used to living in humid environments but avoid using xeric air plants in terrariums since they need drier conditions). Attach hanging air plant holders to the ceiling or a curtain rod. Set one inside a dedicated air plant holder or planter and set it on any surface for decor. Types of Air Plants There are hundreds, if not thousands of plants that can be classified as air plants, or epiphytes, from multiple different plant families. The following are some of the most popular and well-known types of air plants. Orchid (Orchidaceae): The orchid family has a large number of epiphytic plants, including the most common and well-known genus in the family—the phalaenopsis orchids. Epiphytic species in the orchid family use their roots for support and for absorbing water and nutrients from their surrounding environment. Cacti (Cactaceae): Epiphytic cacti (as opposed to desert cacti) are plants in the cactus family that are native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. This includes popular species such as the Christmas cactus, Thanksgiving cactus, Easter cactus, rhipsalis, fishbone cactus, and more. Ferns (Polypodiaceae): Not all ferns are epiphytic, however, certain ferns can be grown either terrestrially (in soil) or epiphytically (soilless). These include staghorn ferns (Platycerium bifurcatum) and birds nest ferns (Asplenium nidus), among others. Overhead view of a fishbone cactus against a white background.

Pruning Air plants generally shed outer or base leaves naturally as new growth comes in, but there may be times when you need to prune them yourself. Pull off any dried-up or dead leaves gently as you spot them. This both keeps the plant pretty and helps regenerate newer growth. As you clear off any old leaves, light will reach the healthy leaves more easily as well. After watering, old leaves can also retain excess moisture causing rot, so it's best to discard them. Additionally, if you have leaves that are partially damaged, trim on an angle with gardening shears just where the injury is. Propagating Air Plants Since the term “air plant” covers a wide variety of plants, there are a few ways that air plants are commonly propagated. Most of the time, epiphytic plants propagate most readily through division of pups from the \"mother plant,\" however some species, such as the tropical cacti, can also be propagated by stem cuttings. Ensure that you research the best way to propagate the specific type of air plant that you have before attempting either of the following two methods. How to Propagate Air Plants by Division Air plants that are healthy and established will begin to grow pups, or offshoots, over time. These can be separated and established as independent plants. Hold the base of the plant and gently wiggle the pup from the mother plant to separate them. If they are not easy to pull apart, you can use a sterile, sharp knife or pair of disinfected scissors to separate them. Once separated, begin caring for your new baby plant like you would for the mother plant. How to Propagate Air Plants by Stem Cuttings Using a pair of sharp, sterile scissors or pruning shears, take stem cuttings that are around 4 to 5 inches long. Set the cuttings aside in a cool, dry location for at least 24 hours to allow the cut edge to form a callus. Fill a small glass or vase with distilled or filtered water and place the bottom of the cutting in the water. Set the cuttings in a location that receives bright, indirect light and refresh the water once a week. After a few weeks, you should begin to notice new roots forming below the water. Potting and Repotting Air Plants Because they require no soil and receive their nutrients from the environment, air plants can thrive in just about any kind of container or pot. Hanging pots, terrariums, and fish bowls are all good options for air plants. If the plant becomes too big for its container, you can repot it. This is the only time repotting is necessary. These are some of the easiest plants to move as long as it's handled carefully in the process with no root breakage. Once your air plant is settled in its new home, you should proceed with caring for it as usual. Common Pests and Plant Diseases The most common pests of air plants are mealybugs and scale insects. Scale bugs look like bumps on the bottoms of the leaves, while mealybugs are tiny white insects that attach anywhere on the plant. Both cause the leaves to turn yellow and wilt. You can try wiping away the bugs with rubbing alcohol every few days until the infestation is eliminated. To prevent them from returning, spray the plant with neem oil on a regular basis. Air plants are vulnerable to rot and fungal diseases if they retain excess moisture. These conditions present as brown or blackened roots that feel squishy when you touch them. To avoid this, refrain from overwatering your plant. or keeping it in extremely humid conditions. How to Get Air Plants to Bloom Air plants bloom only once in their lifetime, making their vibrant flowers worth the wait. Bloom Months When your plant blooms will depend on what species it is. It will not bloom until it's reached maturity which could fall at any point in the year. How Long Do Air Plants Bloom? Each species of air plant will have a different lifecycle for individual blooms. This generally ranges from a few days to a few months. The larger the air plant, the longer the flowering cycle will take. Some larger air plants have blooms that last up to one year. What Does an Air Plant's Flowers Look and Smell Like? Bloom styles will vary depending on the type. Much of the time, flowers are vibrant colors ranging from pink and red to blue and purple. Some species will produce fragrant blooms, and others will not. The species Purpurea is said to smell like cinnamon while the species Duratii is said to have a smell similar to grape soda. How to Encourage More Blooms Given that your air plant is mature and in good health, the blooming will come in due time. Make sure it has enough indirect sunlight and adequate water and has been well fed so it's not lacking in any nutrients. If you notice your air plant’s leaves beginning to change color, often with bright and vibrant shades of red or pink, it's a sign that the plant is probably beginning its blooming cycle. Caring for an Air Plant After it Blooms Once your air plant has completed its bloom cycle, snip back the stalk near the base. This will help the plant focus on creating new offshoots or pups that will become their own new plants over time. This can take several months so be sure to continue with proper care including watering. Once the pups are about 1/3 the size of the mother plant, you can separate each off to live on its own. Deadheading Air Plant Flowers You can deadhead spent flowers as they appear or leave them to dry on the plant until the blooming cycle is complete. If you're deadheading, simply pull the blooms from the bracts. Common Problems With Air Plants The most common problems encountered when growing air plants indoors are usually related to improper watering or humidity conditions. Identifying the issue early is key to saving your plant before it’s too lat. Browning Tips If your air plant’s leaves have brown, crispy tips, this is an indication that your plant is not receiving enough moisture. As a first step, try increasing the humidity around the plant before you increase your watering schedule. This can be done by placing a small humidifier nearby or moving your plant to a more humid room in your home. If the problem persists on any new growth after you make this change, try increasing the frequency of your watering slightly to prevent your plant from drying out too much. Mushy Stems On the other hand, brown, mushy stems are an indication that your air plant has been overwatered. Unfortunately, it is usually hard to save an air plant that has been overwatered unless you catch it early enough. Remove the mushy stems from the plant and skip at least one watering to help dry the plant out a bit. Once you resume watering, cut back slightly from your previous watering schedule. FAQ Do you need to water an air plant? Yes! Contrary to their name, air plants cannot survive on just air, and they do need to be watered regularly. In fact, proper watering is one of the most important parts of caring for an air plant indoors. How fast do air plants grow? Generally, air plants are known for being slow-growers, although with so many different types of plants classified as “air plants,” there are some variations in growth. For example, air plants such as tillandsia and orchids are relatively slow-growing, while tropical cacti and ferns are air plants that tend to grow a little bit faster. Are air plants easy to care for? Overall, air plants are fairly low-maintenance houseplants that are easy to keep happy indoors. The hardest part about their care is getting used to their unique needs compared to the non-epiphytic houseplants that you may be used to. Are air plants good for your home? Just as house plants in soil are good for your home, so are air plants. It's also believed that bromeliads, especially, are beneficial for removing pollution from the air.1 Do you soak air plants upside down? Certain types of air plants, such as xeric air plants that hail from desert-like and rockier climates, should be dunked in water, but not soaked, upside down. That's because this type of air plant can't withstand too much moisture.2\nQuick facts Common name - Air plant 1 Botanical name - Tillandsia spp. 2 Group - Tropical epiphytes (growing on the branches or trunks of host trees without parasitizing them) or lithophytes (growing on rocks) 3 Flowering time - Spring to autumn 4 Planting time - All year 5 Aspect - Bright diffused light 6 Hardiness - Tropical 7 Difficulty - Moderate to difficult 8 Cultivation The most important considerations when cultivating airplants are their requirements for air, light, water and warmth. Plants can be placed outside in the summer in the UK to benefit from the brighter conditions, rainfall and increased humidity . Return them under glass or bring indoors in early autumn. Tillandsia have leaves coated in specialised water-absorbent cells called trichomes which in some species are so dense they give the plants a silvery, frosted appearance. The trichomes are their primary method of obtaining moisture from rainfall or fog. Airplants are often grown on gnarled wood, or shells and rocks to which they are glued for support. The ornamental appearance of Tillandsia and their colourful, exotic-looking flowers make them intriguing and popular plants to grow in the home and conservatories. Ventilation Airplants have evolved in sites which all have superior airflow. It is therefore very important to provide a well-ventilated position for plants to remain healthy. Light levels Tillandsia enjoy bright but diffused light, so provide light shade from direct sunshine, particularly under glass. A position in a south-facing window behind a net curtain is ideal. Watering and feeding From spring until autumn, immerse plants in rainwater on average two to three times a week, allowing them to dry off in between Avoid using tapwater especially in hard water areas as the water contains dissolved sodium bicarbonate which can precipitate out on the trichomes and block them, preventing the Tillandsia from absorbing moisture and nutrients In higher temperatures and low atmospheric humidity , watering may be required more frequently; less often in cooler, humid conditions Misting plants in-between immersing them can help to prevent dehydration in warm conditions, but does not provide sufficient moisture alone so should not be used instead of immersion Avoid watering plants if temperatures drop to 12ºC (54ºF) as they can remain wet for too long In summer, plants can occasionally be left to soak overnight in water to which some fertiliser suitable for orchids has been added. This will ensure they are fully hydrated and able to absorb the fertiliser. Tillandsia will not tolerate being kept in water for longer periods or being kept continuously wet Allowing plants to dry off in between watering is very important for good plant health Plants should be angled facing downwards when mounted, to allow water to drain out of the centre or crown of the plant, or gently shaken after watering to dislodge any water droplets Temperature Plants do best if the temperature does not drop below 12°C (54°F) and can tolerate a maximum of 30°C (86°F) if relative humidity is high. Pruning Most bromeliads including Tillandsia are monocarpic, meaning they grow to maturity, flower, set seed and then die, but not before producing offsets or young plants from the base. The mother plant once it has died completely, can be pruned away, leaving the offsets in situ to grow on; but pruning is not otherwise required. Useful websites: Air Plant City Article on growing tillandsia from seed Bromeliads Air Plant Expert Propagation Offsets Tillandsia are easily propagated by detaching offsets, although it is best to wait until the offsets have reached one third the size of the mother plant before doing so to ensure success. Once they have been detached they can be treated as for an adult plant. You might also want to try taking cuttings from your existing houseplant collection. Find out how > Seed Seeds of Tillandsia need warmth, moisture, light, and good air circulation for germination and survival; Old tights or stockings stretched over a wire frame, or chunks of tree fern fibre can be used as a substrate for germination Spread the seeds thinly so that they have plenty of space and are not touching as this helps when moving them on without damaging them once they have reached manageable size, as well as enabling the seedlings to grow larger Keep in strong but diffused light, good air circulation, high humidity and a temperature of approx. 25°C (75°F) for germination For the first two years or so, the plants require the same growing conditions as for germination Water by misting heavily whenever the surfaces of the young plants appear dry Feed weekly with an orchid feed or a regular liquid feed at one quarter strength Avoid keeping the substrate too moist as this will cause development of algae that can suffocate the young plants Once the plants have reached 1.25cm (½in) in height, they are ready to be separated onto individual pieces of substrate to grow on to flower Cultivar selection Some Tillandsia species in cultivation Tillandsia usneoides (originating from Southern states of USA, C. America and South America): In the wild it grows in large silvery green festoons often several metres long, from branches of trees and even other inanimate structures such as telephone lines. Produces small yellowish green fragrant flowers. Tillandsia caput medusae (originating from C. America and Mexico): Produces silvery, sage-green linear leaves from a swollen bulb-like base. Purple flowers are produced on a reddish spike height 10-15cm (4-6in) spread 15cm (6in). Tillandsia xerographica (originating from C. America and southern Mexico): Produces silvery green leaves that turn blush-pink in bright light. Height and spread 20-25cm (8-9in). Problems Rotting: Rot can cause the centre of the plant or some of the leaves to turn brown or black. It most usually occurs from water collecting in the crown of the plant, in conjunction with poor air circulation. Dehydration: Dried out plants can occur as a combination of infrequent watering, high temperatures and low relative humidity . Plants can sometimes be revived by soaking overnight, but in the long term an adjustment to more favourable watering and growing procedures is required. Extended use of hard water instead of rainwater can also cause dehydration. Shedding leaves: Loss of lower leaves is the result of stress such as from a change of conditions or water stress. This can also be an indication of rot (see above). Brown or bleached leaves: This is usually the result of the plant overheating under glass in direct sunlight, and low relative humidity , causing the foliage to scorch. Provide more shading and raise the humidity around the plants to correct this problem. Slugs and snails : These common pests can be a problem on the plants especially if they have been placed outside for the summer.\nStep 1: Light Air plants grow on trees in tropical regions so they are adapted to having speckled sunlight filtered through a tree’s canopy. In your home, your ceiling blocks out all light so put your tillandsia next to a window. For several years, I’ve kept air plants happy in an East facing window – some direct sun and bright indirect for the rest of the day. If you absolutely must keep your air plant away from the window for decorative purposes (e.g. your office desk), consider leaving it by a window for the weekend so your plant doesn’t starve. Step 2: Watering (Caution*: be sure you have satisfied the requirements of Step 1) Watering an air plant is simple, they just need to get wet often enough so as to not turn crispy brown but not stay so wet that they rot. If you understand this balance, then it doesn’t matter if you mist them frequently or soak them by submersion. Here are my thoughts on the different methods: Misting – I only do this when I feel my air plants are thirsty (e.g. when the tentacles of a caput medusae are tightly curled) AND I know I won’t have time to soak them in the next few days. I don’t really like misting because it gets moisture all over my windowsill and I can’t evenly water all surfaces of my air plants. Soaking – you can do this in the sink, a plastic tub, or even a decorative glass container (just don’t leave them soaking forever). I live in Toronto, where my tap water’s chlorination levels don’t seem to harm my air plants, but if you happen to collect rain water, they’ll be happiest soaking in that! With my air plants getting that bright morning sun and indirect light the rest of the day, I can safely soak my air plants for 15-30 minutes once a week. After the soaking, I shake off the excess water, especially from the bulbous ones, where water might get trapped in the folds. But as long as they’re getting bright light, they’ll use up whatever moisture they’ve stored. * Any instruction on how to water air plants is pointless if your air plants don’t get enough light. Step 3: Display Now that you have done your part for your air plants, it’s time for them to treat you! Because they are not adapted to using their roots to draw water/nutrients, you are free to display them in more ornamental ways. My only caution would be to avoid displays where water can get trapped, allowing mold/bacteria to fester. Ideally, you should also be able to conveniently remove the air plant for soaking. Oh, and did I mention light? Don’t display them where they will starve to death for light! There’s a lot more fun stuff to observe when owning air plants but for now you’re ready to start growing your collection!"

         "My African Mask Plant sits on a long table in my dining room along with eight or nine other plants. I must say, with its magnificent foliage, it steals the show. It’s a stunning indoor plant. However, many gardeners struggle to grow it. These African Mask Plant care tips will help you out. It’s tricky to grow indoors and if it’s not happy, it’ll go downhill fast. The three key points of keeping this plant looking good are exposure, watering, and an above-humidity requirement. I live in the Sonoran Desert in Arizona which is very dry (average humidity of 29%). Despite a few brown tips, mine is doing just fine although it’s certainly not the most robust of my houseplants! This plant shares the same family (Araceae) as many other popular houseplants: anthuriums, pothos, monsteras, philodendrons, aglaonemas, peace lilies, arrowhead plants, and zz plants. I always find this interesting as plants in the same family share similar characteristics. I guess that’s the plant geek in me. I bought this plant labeled as African Mask Plant. The genus and species are most likely Alocasia amazonica and the cultivar is “Polly”. This is a smaller growing hybrid plant that was developed for the houseplant trade as most of the other Alocasias get large. You may also see it called “Kris Plant”. Confusing, I know. Regardless of which one I actually have, the care is the same whether it’s been labeled African Mask Plant or Alocasia Polly.

Of course, it’s growing in a greenhouse! This picture was taken at Cordova Gardens near the San Diego Botanic Garden. Uses They’re most commonly sold as tabletop plants in 6″ pots. You can also find them in 4″ and 8″ pots. As they grow, they not only get taller but spread too. The foliage gets large so it may become a low, wide floor plant (unless you have a lot of room on a table!). Size Alocasia Polly will max out around 2′ x 2′. Other Alocasias can reach 4-6′. I’ve had my plant for almost 4 years now. The leaves have gotten a bit smaller and overall it isn’t as full. When not semi-dormant (more on that under “Care”) it stands about 20″ tall x 18″ wide. Growth Rate Moderate if all conditions are to its liking. This plant not only loves humidity but warm temps too. Mine puts out a big growth spurt in spring and summer. Alocasia African Mask Flowers It has a green spathe-like flower. As an indoor plant, it doesn’t happen on a regular basis if at all. The foliage is what makes this plant desirable. Big Draw This is easy to see – Alocasia Polly has those standout deep green leaves with pronounced veins! Are you looking for another houseplant with gorgeous foliage? Check out the Pink Aglaonema Lady Valentine. close up of the gorgeous foliage of an african mask plant alocasia polly No doubt about it; the foliage is gorgeous. African Mask Plant Care One thing to note about this plant: It goes through a period of dormancy, usually in the fall or winter months. The foliage completely (or almost completely) dies back and then comes back in spring. It grows from underground stems called rhizomes that spread and produce roots, like iris. It’s the end of February, and mine is in that semi-dormant phase now. Alocasia Polly Light Requirements Like many other houseplants, the African Mask Plant needs bright, indirect light. This would be medium or moderate light. It doesn’t do well in low light – the leaves will get smaller and the plant won’t grow. On the other hand, keep it out of the direct sun and away from the hot glass of a window with a south or west exposure. This will cause sunburn. My Alocasia Polly sits 10′ away from an east-facing bay window. You can see this in the video below. I live in Tucson where the sun shines a lot (Arizona is the sunniest state in the US) so this works fine for my houseplants. You may have to rotate your plant every two months or three months so it gets light on all sides. In the winter, you may have to move your plants to a brighter location. More on Houseplant Care In Winter. Alocasia Polly Watering I never let mine completely dry out. As a general rule, I let the soil mix dry out 3/4 of the way before watering again. In the warmer months, I water My African Mask Plant every six to seven days and every twelve to fourteen days in the winter months. Adjust the frequency to your environment and how the plant is drying out. Here’s a guide to Watering Indoor Plants in case you’re interested. I really can’t tell you how often to water yours because there are many variables that come into play. Here are a few: the pot size, the type of soil it’s planted in, the location where it’s growing, and your home’s environment. As much as this plant doesn’t like to dry out, it doesn’t like to stay constantly wet. When my plant is semi-dormant, I water it every fourteen days or so. If your African Mask Plant has yellow leaves, it’s most likely due to overwatering or underwatering. You can cut those leaves off. African Mask Plants aren’t the easiest plants to care for, but here are 15 Easy Care Plants that are great for beginning gardeners. Humidity A lack of humidity makes this beauty tricky to grow. Other plants native to the sub-tropics/tropics do fine in our drier home environments. A moderate to a high level of humidity is key to African Mask Plant care. Sometimes the humidity levels in Tucson are 12%. The average houseplant enjoys a level of around 50%. That’s why my Alocasia Polly isn’t as robust as it was when I bought it. Here’s what I do to increase the humidity factor: The grow pot sits on a saucer filled with rock. I keep the saucer 3/4 full of water. Just make sure the roots don’t sit in the water because that’ll bring on root rot. I remove the plant from its decorative container and take the plant to my deep kitchen sink. Then, I give it a spray and let it sit there for an hour or so. I have a humidity meter in my dining room. I run my Canopy Humidifiers when the humidity reads low, which is a good portion of the time here in the Arizona desert. I run them 4-5 times a week for 6-8 hours depending on the humidity level. If you’ve got a mister bottle, your plant would appreciate a spray two or three times a week. How much, if at all, you need to increase the humidity factor depends on how dry your home is and how your plant is doing. My African Mask Plant has small brown leaf tips. This is in response to the dry air. a long narrow table is filled with a variety of indoor plant a large tree sits on the floor Some of the plants growing in my dining room. And yes, that Anthurium still has a few blooms on it 9 months later! Temperature This plant loves warm temperatures. It’ll tolerate cooler temps but won’t grow as much and be as happy. Fertilizer For Alocasia Besides my worm compost/compost routine every other spring, I feed this plant six to seven times a year during the growing season in spring, summer, and early fall. I fertilize my plants from mid-February through October. We have a long growing season here in Tucson and my houseplants appreciate it. In a colder climate, you may start feeding in late March or April. When my plants are putting new growth and new leaves, it’s my sign to start feeding. For you in a different climate zone with a shorter growing season, feeding two or three times per year may do it for your indoor plants. I feed my container plants indoors and outdoors with Grow Big, liquid kelp, and Maxsea three to seven times during the growing season. By the way, I alternate fertilizers and don’t use them all together. Other options you might consider are would be kelp/seaweed fertilizer and Joyful Dirt. Both are popular and get great reviews. Don’t over-fertilize (use too great a quantity and/or do it too often) because salts can build up and lead to root burn. The lower the light, the less often you’ll fertilize.

Alocasia Soil Mix Recipe The potting mix needs to be aerated and well-draining. My recipe is a combo of 1/3 coco chips, 1/3 pumice (perlite is fine too if that’s what you have), and 1/3 potting soil. I also throw in a few handfuls of charcoal because I have it on hand. The charcoal isn’t necessary but it sweetens the soil and aids in drainage. I also add in a handful or two of organic compost when planting because this plant likes a rich mix. I top dress with a 1/4″ layer of worm compost with a 1″ layer of compost over that. Repotting/Transplanting This is best done in spring or summer; early fall is fine if you’re in a warm climate. Avoid repotting any of your house plants in the winter if you can because it’s their time to rest. The faster your plant is growing, the sooner it’ll need repotting. Repotting your African Mask Plant every two to four years will be fine because it prefers to grow a bit tight in its pot. When I repot mine (which will happen in the next month or two), I’ll go up 1 pot size – from a 6″ grow pot to an 8″ grow pot. It’s best if the pot has drainage holes so the excess water can flow out the bottom of the pot.

It’s best done in the warmer months: spring, summer, and into early fall (if you’re in a climate with warmer winters like me). The process is similar to dividing a ZZ Plant. You can see How I Did That Here. Pruning Not much is needed. The main reason to prune your African Mask Plant is to take off the occasional yellow leaf. Just make sure your Pruners Are Clean and Sharp before you do any pruning. If you’re a beginning gardener and looking for some Easy Care Floor Plants and Easy Tabletop & Hanging Plants, these are some of our faves! Pests Mine hasn’t gotten any. I know they can be susceptible to mealybugs, especially deep inside the new growth. These white, cotton-like pests like to hang out in the nodes and under the leaves. I simply blast them off (lightly!) in the kitchen sink with the spray and that usually does the trick. If not, I use the cotton swab dipped in alcohol and water method. Also, keep your eye out for scale insects, spider mites, and aphids. It’s best to take action as soon as you see any pest because they multiply like crazy. Pests can travel from houseplant to houseplant in no time fast so make you get them under control pronto. Pet Safety Alocasia Polly, like all plants in the Araceae family, is considered to be toxic. I consult the ASPCA website for my info on this subject and see in what way the plant is toxic. Here’s more info on this for you.\nAlocasia amazonica ‘Polly’ is a compact houseplant from the elephant ear family, known for its distinctive glossy leaves that conjure up images of an Amazonian jungle—despite not being from the Amazon (or any jungle, for that matter). Also known as the African mask plant, it’s the most popular Alocasia grown indoors. Linda Ly Written by Linda Ly Beginner's guide to caring for Alocasia Polly (African mask plant) What’s in this post Looking for a spectacular houseplant that really catches the eye? It’s hard to go wrong with the genus Alocasia, especially a relatively recent cultivar known as Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’. All of the flair of its parent plant, Alocasia amazonica, but in a more compact package perfect for smaller spaces! Keep reading for everything you need to know about Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’ plant care, with extensive growing tips for helping this aroid thrive indoors.

Underside of an Alocasia amazonica Polly leaf About Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’ Natural habitat As I mentioned in the introduction, Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’ is a cultivar. The more detailed version is that it’s a variety of Alocasia x amazonica. It was selectively bred to stay smaller than its parent plant—which, by the way, isn’t a natural species either.

Alocasia x amazonica is a hybrid produced by crossing two other Alocasia species: Alocasia watsoniana (which is now more correctly known as Alocasia longiloba ‘Watsoniana’) and Alocasia sanderiana. It was bred in the 1950s by Salvadore Mauro, a Florida greenhouse grower who owned the (now defunct) Amazon Nursery and named the new hybrid after his business. All this means is that technically speaking, Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’ doesn’t have a natural habitat, and it certainly did not originate in the Amazon or anywhere near it! Still, knowing where a plant came from tells us a lot about what it likes in the home, so let’s have a look at where its grandparents originated: Alocasia watsoniana: Tropical forests in southern China and Southeast Asia. Alocasia sanderiana: Tropical forested areas in the Philippines. Description It’s not difficult to see why so many houseplant enthusiasts are attracted to Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’. It truly is a beautiful plant and very easy to recognize from its leathery-looking leaves. The foliage, which sprouts from a central corm, is quite dramatic: arrow-shaped and very dark green with lighter, creamy green midribs. What makes ‘Polly’ different from its parent, Alocasia x amazonica, is its size. Like other elephant ears, Amazonica can be quite a large plant (I’ve seen some grow to be 3 1/2 feet or more!), which makes it all the more spectacular but not ideal for smaller spaces. Horticulturists to the rescue: They selectively bred for smaller specimens (a subgroup called the Jewel Alocasias), leading to the cultivar we now know as Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’. Read more: 23 Gorgeous Alocasia Varieties to Grow at Home (With Pictures) Alocasia x amazonica varieties There’s only one Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’, but did you know that this is not the only cultivar produced through selective cultivation of its parent plant, Alocasia x amazonica? And that horticulturists have actually produced yet more cultivars using ‘Polly’ as a parent plant? I almost need a plant family tree to keep track of it all! These are the varieties I’m aware of (feel free to contact me if you have one to add): Original Alocasia x amazonica: Daughter of Sanderiana x Watsoniana. Very large, shiny green foliage. Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’: Daughter of Amazonica. Medium-large, shiny green foliage. Alocasia amazonica ‘Ivory Coast’: Daughter of Amazonica. Arrow-shaped leaves without the wavy edges. Alocasia amazonica ‘Bambino Arrow’: Daughter of Polly. Dwarf version with thinner, matte foliage. Alocasia ‘Mandalay’: Daughter of Polly. Rounder leaves with more pronounced veins. Don’t forget, there are quite a few Alocasia species and cultivars that look similar to the ones mentioned here. I used to own an Alocasia ‘Sarian’, for example, whose leaves were not that different but which is an entirely different species! Did you know? Apparently, Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’ was originally called ‘Poly’. This ended up changing to ‘Polly’ as the years passed and the plant became more popular. Where to buy Florida Plants Gardens The Green Escape The Longevity Garden Alocasia Polly houseplant in a black speckled container on a wooden shelf Caring for Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’ Light and temperature When considering care factors like light and temperature for your Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’, keep in mind its grandparents’ tropical rainforest habitat. Species in the undergrowth don’t receive direct sun—taller trees block out the strongest rays—but they aren’t in the dark either. In the home, your plant will appreciate a windowsill spot with plenty of light, but not too much harsh sun.

Because the areas Alocasias naturally inhabit never experience much of a chill, they haven’t evolved to withstand the cold. You’ll have to keep yours warm in the home. Room temperature is ideal, although warmer won’t be an issue either. Just try to keep the temperature above 65°F to prevent your Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’ from thinking it’s time to go into hibernation. Water and humidity Tropical rainforests are pretty humid places and that’s exactly what Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’ will need in the home as well. Keep your plant’s soil lightly moist at all times, especially during the warm summer months. You can let it dry a little further during winter, but never completely. When it comes to humidity, it can be helpful to use a hygrometer (humidity meter) to figure out whether you’re good or need to take action. It should read 50 percent or higher for a happy Alocasia. (This is the hygrometer I use indoors.) If it’s significantly lower, your plant can suffer, so consider one or more of the following options: Placing your Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’ in a more humid area in the home. The kitchen or bathroom can be more humid and work well if they offer sufficient light. Grouping plants together so they can take advantage of the moisture each one expels. Running a humidifier near your plant. Using a greenhouse cabinet, terrarium, or humidity box lined with sphagnum peat moss. Soil and planting The genus Alocasia forms part of the family Araceae, the aroids (a group that includes popular houseplants like Syngonium podophyllum, Monstera deliciosa, and Rhaphidophora tetrasperma). The majority of these plant prefer a loose, well-draining soil type. Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’ is no exception. It really doesn’t appreciate compact mixes, which prevent air from getting to the roots and might not drain quickly enough. Sure, this cultivar likes its soil lightly moist, but that’s not the same as soaking wet: the medium should let excess water drain quickly to prevent the corm from rotting. Most houseplant enthusiasts report their Alocasias thriving best in special aroid soil, which may or may not contain potting soil. Although you can buy aroid soil from specialty plant shops, it’s also pretty easy to make yourself with the right ingredients. All you need is something to retain a bit of moisture (like sphagnum moss, potting soil, or coco coir) paired with elements that promote drainage (like orchid bark, perlite, pumice charcoal, etc.). An example of an easy mix could be potting soil, bark, perlite, and sphagnum moss in equal quantities. As for the perfect planter, you’re good as long as it has a drainage hole. This species isn’t too fussy about pot size, although you should repot to a larger container if the soil starts drying out too quickly or the roots stick out of the drainage hole. Recommended products for Alocasia plant care: FoxFarm Ocean Forest Potting Soil Perfect Plants Organic Perlite Better-Gro Orchid Bark Better-Gro Orchid Moss Fertilizing Alocasias like this one aren’t heavy feeders, but they still appreciate a boost from time to time during the spring and summer growing months. You can use a diluted regular houseplant fertilizer once a month during watering.

Stop fertilizing during the winter months, if your Alocasia isn’t growing well or if it shows signs of going dormant (see more on that below). It won’t be able to take up the extra nutrients. Recommended fertilizers for Alocasia: Maxsea All-Purpose Seaweed Plant Food Houseplant Resource Center Liquid Fertilizer for Houseplants Instant Biologics Instant Plant Food (Fizzing Nutrient Tablets) Pruning Your Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’ generally won’t need any pruning, except maybe to remove the occasional tattered or dried-up leaf. If your plant has grown too large for your taste, you’re better off having a look at the section on propagation below! Dividing or repotting As mentioned earlier, you probably won’t have to repot your Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’ too frequently, at least not to a larger planter. The plant likes to be slightly rootbound, so it only needs to be repotted once every few years, if needed. Still, it does appreciate some fresh soil from time to time. Repotting is best done during the spring and summer growing months. During repotting, you can usually choose to also divide an Alocasia. What looks like one plant above the soil can actually consist of multiple corms and clumps, each with their own root systems. These can be potted up separately if you prefer multiple smaller plants over a single large one. Close-up of Alocasia amazonica Polly leaf with prominent cream midribs Propagating Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’ Like all other Alocasia varieties (including Alocasia zebrina and Alocasia ‘Black Velvet’), ‘Polly’ grows from a central corm. That means, unfortunately, that it’s not a candidate for stem propagation. Division is your best bet if you’d like to multiply your plant. Luckily, a mature Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’ will usually do most of the work for you: it grows in a clumping manner that should make it easy to take apart. If you’d like to divide your Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’, you can do so as follows: Take the plant out of its container and shake off the excess soil. Lay it out on a trash bag to see what you’re dealing with. In many cases, different sections will already come apart at this point. Are any of the clumps you’re eyeing attached to each other? That’s not a problem. Cut vertically with a clean knife to separate them, taking care to leave the root system on each one intact. If any of the clumps lack a root system, you can root them in water or moist sphagnum peat moss. Rooted clumps can be potted in normal aroid soil. Give them a drink of water. Although they can sulk a bit at first, they should continue growing as usual. How do you bring a dormant Alocasia back? Alocasias, including Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly,’ can go dormant. This is a protective reaction that happens if they’re kept too cold or dark. It can happen in winter if your windowsills tend to get chilly!

I agree to my personal data being used for interest-based advertising as outlined in the Privacy Notice. Website Your Email... Yes Sign Me Up! A dormant Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’ will stop growing and most likely shed its foliage. It can end up reduced to nothing but a corm in the soil, but that doesn’t mean it’s dead. Once things warm up in springtime, you can try to wake it up. If the corm is still firm, it’ll likely come back fine. Here’s how you do it: Provide warmth: Place the planter on a heat mat or inside a clear plastic bag to keep the heat in. Provide light: Find a spot near a window or consider supplementing with artificial light. Provide water: Preferably lukewarm. Think jungle rainstorm. Keep this up, without soaking the soil too much, and you should see the first signs of life within a few weeks. Common questions about Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’ care How fast does Alocasia ‘Polly’ grow? Alocasia ‘Polly’ is a fast-growing plant. On average, it grows one to two new leaves every month, though smaller plants may start out a little more slowly. How do you keep Alocasia leaves shiny? Cleaning the leaves on your Alocasia plant not only keeps it looking good, it also removes dust and reduces pests like spider mites. The easiest way to bring on the shine is by carefully wiping down the top and bottom of your leaves with a soft, damp cloth. Alocasias also appreciate taking a lukewarm shower in the sink or bathtub a couple times a year to cleanse their leaves of dust, dirt, dander, and other particles. Can Alocasia ‘Polly’ go outside? Absolutely, Alocasias thrive outside in warm climates. In the summer, you can move your potted Alocasia plant outdoors in partial shade to dappled sun (like under a covered porch or tree canopy). Just remember to bring it back inside if temperatures dip below 65°F, and don’t leave it out in direct sun for too long (which can burn the leaves). Is Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’ toxic to cats and dogs? Unfortunately, Alocasia amazonica ‘Polly’ contains calcium oxalate crystals that cause a burning sensation when touched, especially in the mouth. You should keep this plant away from pets and kids.\nAlocasia Polly Care guide: The Easiest Alocasia to Keep Alocasia Polly, also known as Alocasia Amazonica or African Mask plant, is a stunning tropical houseplant renowned for its unique foliage and striking appearance. This comprehensive care guide will provide valuable insights and detailed instructions to ensure your Alocasia Polly thrives and becomes a captivating centrepiece in your indoor garden. Alocasia Polly is often considered one of the easiest Alocasia varieties to maintain due to its relatively low maintenance requirements and adaptability to indoor environments. Here are a few reasons why Alocasia Polly is considered beginner-friendly: Tolerant of varying light conditions: Alocasia Polly can tolerate a range of light conditions, from medium to bright indirect light. Whilst it prefers bright light, it can adapt to lower light conditions, making it more forgiving for indoor spaces with less natural light. Moderate watering needs: Alocasia Polly enjoys consistent moisture but dislikes sitting in waterlogged soil. It is more forgiving when it comes to watering mistakes than other Alocasia varieties. If you allow the top inch of soil to dry out slightly before watering, you can avoid overwatering and prevent root rot. Adaptability to average humidity: Whilst Alocasia plants generally appreciate high humidity, Alocasia Polly can tolerate average household humidity levels. This means you don't necessarily need to provide additional humidity or create a humid environment to keep it happy. Resilience to pests and diseases: Alocasia Polly is relatively resistant to common pests and diseases. Although it is not completely immune, it tends to have fewer issues with pests like mealybugs and spider mites compared to some other Alocasia varieties. Regular monitoring and proper care can help prevent and address any pest or disease problems. Manageable size: Alocasia Polly typically grows to a manageable size, making it suitable for a variety of indoor spaces. It does not grow as large as some other Alocasia varieties, making it easier to accommodate in smaller living spaces. Alocasia Polly care guide in detail Light Requirements: Alocasia Polly thrives in bright, indirect light. Place your plant near a window with filtered sunlight, where it can receive several hours of gentle morning or afternoon sun. Avoid exposing it to direct sunlight, as it can scorch the leaves. If your plant leans towards the light, rotate it regularly to ensure even growth. Temperature and Humidity: Maintain a warm and humid environment for your Alocasia Polly. It prefers a temperature range between 18°C and 26°C (65°F and 80°F). High humidity levels are beneficial, so consider using a humidifier or placing a tray of water filled with pebbles near the plant to increase humidity. Avoid placing it near draughts or cold air-conditioning vents, which can cause temperature fluctuations and dryness. Watering: Alocasia Polly enjoys consistent moisture but dislikes sitting in waterlogged soil. Water your plant thoroughly when the top inch of soil feels slightly dry. Use room temperature water and ensure proper drainage by using a well-draining potting mix that contains ingredients like peat moss, perlite, and sand. Water the plant until water flows through the drainage holes, and discard any excess water accumulating in the saucer. During warmer months, you may need to water more frequently, while in winter, reduce the frequency as the plant's growth slows down. Soil and Potting: Alocasia Polly prefers well-draining soil that retains some moisture. Use a high-quality, well-aerated potting mix specifically designed for tropical plants. You can create a suitable mix by combining equal parts of peat moss, perlite, and potting soil. Ensure the pot has drainage holes to prevent waterlogging. Repot your plant every one to two years or when it outgrows its current container. Choose a pot that is only slightly larger than the current one to avoid excessive moisture retention. Fertilizing: Feed your Alocasia Polly with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer formulated for houseplants. Dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength and apply it every two months during the growing season (spring and summer). Avoid overfertilizing, as this can lead to salt buildup and damage the plant. During winter, when the plant's growth slows down, reduce fertilization frequency to once every two to three months. Always follow the instructions on the fertilizer packaging for proper dilution and application.

Pruning: Pruning Alocasia Polly is mainly done to remove any dead, damaged, or yellowing leaves. Use clean, sharp pruning shears or scissors to make clean cuts near the base of the leaf stem. Pruning can be done throughout the year as needed. Additionally, you can trim any leggy or straggly growth to encourage a more compact and bushy appearance. Avoid cutting off more than one-third of the plant's foliage at a time. Pests and Diseases: Alocasia Polly is generally resistant to pests, but it can occasionally be susceptible to common houseplant pests such as mealybugs, spider mites, and scale insects. Regularly inspect your plant for signs of infestation, including tiny webs, white cotton-like clusters, or visible insects on the leaves. If detected, isolate the affected plant to prevent further spread and treat it with an appropriate insecticidal soap or horticultural oil, following the product instructions. Ensure good airflow around the plant to prevent the development of fungal diseases. Common Questions about Alocasia Polly (Alocasia Amazonica): Can Alocasia Polly tolerate low light conditions?

Alocasia Polly can be cultivated and kept indoors year-round. With the right conditions and basic care, alocasia Polly is a pretty low-maintenance, easy-growing plant. It does best in filtered, dappled sunlight. Alocasia Polly and other tropical elephant ear plants are considered invasive in mild, wetland climates such as the Gulf Coast of the United States. Before planting alocasia Polly outdoors, consult your local extension agent to check if this plant is an invasive species in your region, or simply keep it indoors as a houseplant. Because it's mildly toxic, alocasia Polly should be kept out of reach of children and pets.1 Read on for our care guide. Common Name: Alocasia Polly, African mask plant, elephant's ear Botanical Name: Alocasia × amazonica 'Polly' Family: Araceae Plant Type: Bulb Mature Size: 1-2 ft. tall and wide Sun Exposure: Part shade Soil Type: Moist, rich, well-drained Soil pH: Acidic Bloom Time: Summer Flower Color: Pale green, cream Native Area: Southern Asia Toxicity: Toxic to people and pets1 Alocasia Polly Care Here are the main care requirements for growing alocasia Polly: Grows best with lots of filtered or dappled light. Needs moist soil. Likes high humidity and warm temperatures. Raised view of alocasia polly leaves Credit: The Spruce / Michelle Becker Closeup of veining on an alocasia polly Front view of alocasia polly on a wooden table Light Alocasia Polly grows best with bright, indirect light, such as from an east-facing window out of direct sun. In brighter spaces, sheer curtains can help filter harsh sunlight and protect the plant's leaves from sunburn. Too much light can also cause leaves to look washed out and pale. Soil Plant your alocasia Polly in a rich, well-drained potting soil that contains organic matter to help retain moisture. Water Water your alocasia Polly so that the soil stays consistently moist. This can be a delicate balance, as soggy soil can lead to root rot, but dry soil can trigger dormancy in the plant. Avoid getting the leaves wet while watering to minimize the risk of plant disease. In winter, when the plant is not actively growing, water just when the top of the soil is beginning to dry out. Temperature and Humidity Alocasia Polly needs temperatures above 65°F or so to thrive. Lower temperatures can damage or kill the plant, so keep it out of cold spaces and drafty areas. A warm space with high humidity provides an ideal climate, making this a great bathroom plant. You can also group alocasia Polly in the same space with other humidity-loving tropicals and run a humidifier to add moisture to the air. Fertilizer Fertilize your alocasia Polly regularly during the growing season. Begin feeding the plant with organic houseplant fertilizer diluted to half strength every two weeks in spring, then stop fertilizing at the end of summer. Start this routine back up when spring comes around again. Pruning Since alocasia Polly is pretty slow-growing, especially when kept indoors, pruning is typically not needed to shape the plant or control its growth. Cut back dead or damaged leaves in spring or summer when the plant has the energy to put out new growth. Use sterilized pruners or shears and cut back leaves at the base of the stem. While alocasia Polly rarely blooms while kept indoors, it's a good idea to prune back any spent flower heads to help promote leaf growth. Propagating Alocasia Polly If your healthy alocasia Polly is growing from at least two bulbs with two leaves, you can propagate the plant by division. If you have a mature plant that's beginning to crowd its pot, division is a great solution. The best time to propagate alocasia Polly is during the spring and summer when the plant is actively growing. Here's how to propagate alocasia Polly by division: Carefully remove your alocasia Polly from its pot. Using your fingers, gently remove the soil from around the root ball. You may find corms—small, dormant bulblets—in the soil. You can plant them in fresh soil along with the rest of the plant, where they'll eventually sprout, or try this water-based method of getting the corms to grow more quickly. Separate the clumps of rhizomes with your fingers. Avoid cutting or breaking the rhizome. Replant each clump in a new, appropriately sized pot with fresh soil and give it a deep watering. Keep the soil evenly moist and put the divisions in a warm place with bright, indirect light. Potting and Repotting Alocasia Polly Alocasia Polly should be repotted every two to three years to refresh its soil. If you see roots growing out of the drainage hole in the bottom of the pot, or if water doesn't seem to infiltrate the soil and runs down the sides of the pot instead of being absorbed, the plant is rootbound and will benefit from repotting. Plan to repot in the spring when the plant is out of dormancy, by putting it into a container one size larger than the previous pot. Use fresh soil and plant in a plastic or glazed ceramic pot rather than terra cotta to help maintain soil moisture. Overwintering During winter, your indoor alocasia Polly may stop growing or even look a little dull and droopy. That's normal for the season, with its cold temperatures and short days. However, if your plant is exposed to very cold temperatures, less light, and dry soil all at once, it may drop all of its leaves and go dormant. Don't worry—your plant isn't dead. Simply cut back on watering and wait for spring, when leaves should regrow. You can avoid dormancy in winter by using a grow light and keeping your alocasia Polly in a space that's at least 70°F. Common Pests & Plant Diseases Alocasia Polly is susceptible to common houseplant pests like spider mites, scale, mealybugs, and aphids. Keep an eye on your plant and check its foliage regularly to catch a potential infestation early. If you do spot a pest problem, remove the offenders with rubbing alcohol or neem oil and quarantine the affected plant from the rest of your collection. How to Get Alocasia Polly to Bloom Bloom Months Alocasia Polly blooms in the summer months. What Do Alocasia Polly's Flowers Look Like? These plants grow small, pale flowers that are white or yellow. How to Encoure More Bloom Alocasia Polly will bloom under the right conditions. Ensure plenty of bright, indirect light and consistent moisture. Remove dead flowers to encourage more bloom. Common Problems With Alocasia Polly Alocasia Polly is pretty easy to care for in the right conditions, but even the most green-thumbed growers occasionally run into issues. Here are some common challenges you might come across with this houseplant. Brown Patches on Leaves Harsh, direct sunlight can scorch your alocasia Polly's leaves, creating brown spots. Move the plant to a location out of direct sunlight. Leaves Turning Yellow Overwatering or underwatering can cause yellow leaves. Check the soil moisture and adjust accordingly. Drooping or Losing Leaves This can be a sign of your alocasia Polly responding to seasonal changes in light and temperature during winter and either slowing growth or going into dormancy. Keep the plant warm and the soil moist, and consider using a grow light to extend hours of light per day.\nhow to care for alocasia quick care guide alocasia polly Once a week in summer; once every two weeks in winter Does best with bright, indirect light but can also handle medium light Fertilize every week during growing season Toxic to pets – keep out of reach Strong air purifier Slightly easier than other Alocasia varieties, the Alocasia Polly grows best with bright, indirect light in a loose, fertile potting mix with excellent drainage. Water her when the top 2.5 cm of soil is dry and mist the large leaves to increase humidity. Keep temperatures between 18°C – 27°C and fertilize every 1 or 2 weeks during the growing season. detailed care guide for alocasia polly Scientific Name: Alocasia Amazonica ‘Polly’ (also known as Alocasia Polly, African Mask Plant, Elephant Ear Plant) Origin: Hybrid plant, parents are originally from southeast Asia Light: Bright, indirect light. Avoid excessive direct sunlight. Water: Maintain evenly moist but not soggy soil during the growing season, watering when the surface begins to dry. Reduce watering significantly in winter. Soil: Lightweight, well-draining potting mix. Temperature: The Alocasia Polly performs best with indoor temperatures ranging between 18°C – 27°C Fertilizer: Fertilize every 1 – 2 weeks during the growing season with a light fertilizer. Dilute to half strength, particularly in spring and autumn. There is no need to fertilize during the winter. Flush the potting mix every 2-3 months. Humidity: Alocasia originate from South East Asia, meaning high humidity is mandatory for quality growth. Mist both sides of the leaves once a week in summer and twice in winter; browning leaf-tips are a big sign that the surrounding air moisture is too low. Moderate to high humidity levels are required, ideally greater than 50% humidity. Pruning: Remove yellowed or dying leaves and plant debris to encourage better growth and all-round growing conditions. When removing dying flowers or leaves, use clean scissors or shears to reduce the chance of bacterial and fungal diseases, and remember to make clean incisions as too much damage can shock the plant. Re-Potting: Depending on how robustly it is growing, you might not have to repot for several years, if for no other reason than to refresh the soil. It is best to do the repotting when the plant begins its active growth in spring. Propagation: The plant may produce pups that can be separated from the main plant or can be propagated by dividing the rhizome when repotting in springtime. Diseases and Pests: When given proper care and grown in preferred conditions, Alocasia Amazonica is not plagued by any major disease problems. The biggest threat is root rot due to overly wet conditions. Although Alocasia Amazonica requires soil that is consistently moist for healthy growth that doesn’t mean it will tolerate prolonged periods of wet feet due to soggy soil. Toxicity: Toxic to pets and humans if ingested. Members of the Araceae family typically contain poisonous calcium oxalate crystals, with Alocasia being no exception. Other members of this family include Philodendron, Zamioculcas (ZZ Plants) and Spathiphyllum (Peace Lilies). If eaten, vomiting, nausea with a loss of appetite could occur and consumption of large quantities must be dealt with quickly. alocasia polly origins & overview The Alocasia Polly is a compact cultivar of the Alocasia Amazonica tropical plant. It’s thought that Alocasia Polly is a hybrid of two species — Alocasia watsoniana and Alocasia sanderiana. Alocasia Polly is prized for its spectacular glossy arrowhead leaves with large protruding silvery-green or white veins. The plants grow up to 0.6 m tall with a similar-sized spread. The Alocasia ‘Polly’ has spreading rhizome roots that make the plant easy to propagate. alocasia polly light requirements Alocasia Amazonica Polly needs plenty of bright indirect light to thrive indoors. It’s crucial to protect the Polly plant from direct sunlight to prevent scorching the leaves. Also, avoid putting Alocasia ‘Polly’ plants in dark rooms or constant shade. The growth will slow, and you’ll lose the vibrant leaf colors. The best location to grow Alocasia Polly plants is near a bright window. But if the window faces south or west, it’s best to protect the tropical plant behind a sheer curtain. how to water the alocasia polly You should water an Alocasia ‘Polly’ plant often enough to keep the plant roots slightly moist. The best watering method is to water often with little amounts of water. Before watering, always ensure the top 2.5 cm of soil is dry before watering. The watering frequency depends on how fast the top layer of soil dries. Letting the soil dry before watering ensures that you never overwater your houseplants. Watering too often causes the roots to rot, which will eventually kill the Alocasia plant. If you don’t water enough, the roots will not get enough moisture, and the plant will wilt. Most houseplants thrive when you drench the soil between watering. However, with Alocasia plants, that could risk causing root rot. So, provide enough water to reach to the roots and only water when the soil partially dries. repotting the alocasia polly Unless you received your Alocasia Amazonica in a very small pot, you won’t have to worry about repotting it until it totally outgrows its present container and the roots are growing out of it. Depending on how robustly it is growing, you might not have to repot for several years, if for no other reason than to refresh the soil. It is best to do the repotting when the plant begins its active growth in spring. When it comes to repotting the Alocasia Amazonica, there are several important things to keep in mind. Only repot the plant into a container that is one size larger than the present one. Repotting into a container that is too large means there’s a good chance of the soil remaining soggy and too wet. Although the Alocasia Polly prefers growing in a moist medium, it doesn’t like to have soggy feet. Pots of any material work well provided they have a bottom drain hole. However, those made of a porous material like clay will have the soil drying out quicker than in pots made of plastic. Use a well-aerated and quick draining soil, as outlined in the soil section of the article. Don’t use soil that is heavy like a straight potting soil as it has a tendency to remain too wet, creating problems with rot."

Whether you’re a seasoned plant parent or someone who’s just managed to keep a cactus alive, aloe vera is your new low-maintenance best friend. Not only does it look cool with its spiky green leaves, but it moonlights as a natural remedy for life’s little burns and boo-boos. From choosing the perfect sunny windowsill to knowing when (and when not) to water, we’re here to make sure your aloe thrives, not just survives. Let’s get growing! About Aloe Vera Aloe vera is a succulent plant species of the genus Aloe. The plant is stemless or short-stemmed with thick, greenish, fleshy leaves that fan out from the plant’s central stem. The margin of the leaf is serrated with small teeth. Before you buy an aloe, note that you’ll need a location that offers bright, indirect sunlight (or artificial sunlight). Direct sunlight can dry out the plant too much and turn its fleshy leaves yellow, so you may need to water more often if your aloe lives in an exceedingly sunny spot. Keep the aloe vera plant in a pot near a kitchen window for periodic use. WARNING: The gel from aloe vera leaves can be used topically but should NOT be eaten by people or pets. It can cause unpleasant symptoms such as nausea or indigestion and may even be toxic in larger quantities. Read Next Aloe Vera: A Self-Regenerating First-Aid Kit Top Succulent Plants for the Home Houseplant Care Guide Planting Before Planting Aloe Vera It’s important to choose the right type of container. A pot made from terra-cotta or similar porous material is recommended, as it will allow the soil to dry thoroughly between waterings and will also be heavy enough to keep the plant from tipping over. A plastic or glazed pot may also be used, though these will hold more moisture. When choosing a container, pick one with at least one drainage hole in the bottom. This is key, as the hole will allow excess water to drain out. Aloe vera plants are hardy, but a lack of proper drainage can cause rot and wilting, which is easily the most common cause of death for this plant. Select a container that’s about as wide as it is deep. If your aloe plant has a stem, choose a container deep enough to plant the entire stem under the soil. Aloe vera plants are succulents, so use a well-draining potting mix, such as those made for cacti and succulents. Do not use gardening soil. A good mix should contain perlite, lava rock, chunks of bark, or all three. A layer of gravel, clay balls, or any other drainage material in the bottom of the pot is not necessary. This only takes up space that the roots could otherwise be using. A drainage hole is drainage enough! (Optional) To encourage your aloe to put out new roots after planting, dust the stem of the plant with a rooting hormone powder. Rooting hormone can be found at a local garden center or hardware store or bought online. how to care for aloe vera infographic How to Plant (or Repot) an Aloe Vera Plant If your aloe plant has grown leggy, has gotten too large, or simply needs an upgrade, it’s time to repot it. Here’s how: Prepare your pot. After giving the new pot a quick rinse (or a good scrub if it’s a pot you’ve used before) and letting it dry thoroughly, place a small piece of screen over the drainage hole; this will keep the soil from falling out the bottom and will allow water to drain properly. A doubled-up piece of paper towel or newspaper can also work in a pinch, though these will break down over time. Prepare your plant. Remove the aloe vera plant from its current pot and brush away any excess dirt from the roots, being careful not to damage the roots. If your plant has any pups, remove them now. (See “Care” below for instructions on removing and potting pups.) If your plant has a very long, spindly stem that won’t fit in the pot, it is possible to trim the stem off partially. Note that this is risky and could kill the plant. To trim the stem: Cut off part of the stem, leaving as much as possible on the plant. Next, place the bare plant in a warm area that gets indirect light. After several days, a callus will form over the wound. At this point, continue with the repotting instructions below. Plant your plant. Fill the pot about a third of the way with a well-draining potting mix, then place your plant in the soil. Continue filling in the soil around the plant, bearing in mind that you should leave at least 3/4 of an inch of space between the top of the soil and the rim of the pot. The bottom leaves of the aloe plant should rest just above the soil, too. Do not water after planting. Ignore your plant (temporarily). After you’ve placed your aloe in its new pot, don’t water it for at least a week. This will decrease the chance of inducing rot and give the plant time to put out new roots. Until the plant seems to be rooted and happy, please keep it in a warm place that receives bright but indirect light. Aloe vera plants in pots Growing How to Care for an Aloe Vera Plant Lighting: Place in bright, indirect sunlight or artificial light. A western or southern window is ideal. Aloe that are kept in low light often grow leggy. Temperature: Aloe vera does best in temperatures between 55° and 80°F (13° and 27°C). The temperatures of most homes and apartments are ideal. From May to September, you can bring your plant outdoors without any problems, but do bring it back inside in the evening if nights are cold. Fertilizing: Fertilize sparingly (no more than once a month) and only in the spring and summer with a balanced houseplant formula mixed at 1/2 strength. Repotting: Repot when root-bound, following the instructions given in “Planting” above. Watering Aloe Vera Watering is the most challenging part of keeping aloe vera healthy, but it’s certainly not rocket science! The aloe is a succulent plant accustomed to arid environments, but its thick leaves still need sufficient water. Water aloe vera plants deeply but infrequently. In other words, the soil should feel moist after watering but should be allowed to dry out to some extent before you water again. If the soil stays overly wet, the plant’s roots can rot. To ensure that you’re not overwatering your plant, allow the top third of potting soil to dry out between waterings. For example, if your plant is kept in 6 inches of potting soil, allow the top 2 inches to dry out before watering again. (Use your finger to test the dryness of the soil.) Generally speaking, plan to water your aloe plant about every 2–3 weeks in the spring and summer and even more sparingly during the fall and winter. One rule to remember for fall and winter watering is to roughly double the time between waterings (compared to your summer watering schedule). In other words, if you water every 2 weeks in summer, water every 4 weeks in winter. When watering, some excess water may run out of the bottom of the pot. Let the pot sit in this water so the soil absorbs as much as possible. Wait 10–15 minutes, then dump any remaining water. Aloe vera plants and pups Photo by cgdeaw/Shutterstock Removing and Replanting Aloe Vera Offsets (Pups) Mature aloe vera plants often produce offsets— plantlets, pups, or babies—that can be removed to produce an entirely new plant (a clone of the mother plant, technically). Find where the offsets are attached to the mother plant and separate them using pruning shears, scissors, or a sharp knife. Leave at least an inch of stem on the offset. Allow the offsets to sit out of the soil for several days; this lets the offset form a callus over the cut, which helps to protect it from rot. Keep the offsets in a warm location with indirect light during this time. Once the offsets have formed calluses, pot them in a standard succulent potting mix. The soil should be well-draining. Put the newly potted pups in a sunny location. Wait at least a week to water and keep the soil on the dry side. How to Get Your Aloe Vera to Flower Mature aloe vera plants occasionally produce a tall flower spike—called an inflorescence—from which dozens of tubular yellow or red blossoms appear. This certainly adds another level of interest to the already lovely aloe! Unfortunately, a bloom is rarely achievable with aloes that are kept as houseplants since the plant requires nearly ideal conditions to produce flowers: lots of light, sufficient water, and the right temperature range. Due to these requirements (mainly lighting), aloe flowers are usually only seen on plants grown outdoors year-round in warm climates. To give your aloe the best shot at flowering: Provide it with as much light as possible, especially during spring and summer. Aloes can be kept outdoors in full sun during the summer when temperatures are above 70°F (21°C). Bring the aloe inside if nighttime temps threaten to drop below 60°F (16°C). Note: Don’t move your aloe from indoors to full sun right away; it needs time to adjust to the intense light, or it may cause sunburn. Allow it to sit in partial shade for about a week before moving it to a brighter location. Ensure the plant is getting the right amount of water—enough to keep it from drying out completely but not enough to drown it! If the plant’s being kept outdoors, make sure that it’s not getting consistently soaked by summer rains. Give your aloe a proper dormancy period in the fall and winter. Aloe tends to bloom in late winter or early spring, so giving them a period of rest consisting of less frequent watering and cooler temperatures may encourage them to flower. Don’t be surprised if it still doesn’t flower. Despite our best efforts, indoor conditions just aren’t ideal for most aloes, so don’t be surprised if yours simply refuses to bloom! Types Especially attractive Aloe include: Aloe variegata Tiger or Partridge-Breasted Aloe – A compact aloe characterized by short, smooth leaves with uneven white stripes. A. aristata Lace Aloe – A small plant with white-spotted, finely sawtoothed leaves. A. glauca Blue Aloe – A larger aloe species with silver-blue leaves. Harvesting Aloe Vera Gel To make use of the aloe vera plant’s soothing properties, remove a mature leaf from the plant and cut it lengthwise. Squeeze the gel out of the leaf and apply it to your burn, or lay the opened leaf, gel side down, on the affected area. Learn more about aloe vera’s healing properties.

One of aloe’s most famous uses is to soothe sunburnt skin, and it can be also used for cold sores.\nPlant Spotlight: Aloe Vera March 30, 2021 Kate Higham This popular, happy-go-lucky indoor plant, quite frankly, had us at Aloe (sorry, we had to!) Aloe Vera, also known by its botanical name “Aloe barbadensis”, is a succulent family member with over 300 species found worldwide. This desert-native plant enjoys hot and tropical climates. It’s reasonably drought-resistant and can be found worldwide from the Californian coastline to the tip of Africa. The aloe vera plant has a long rich history and is known as one of the oldest plants on record due to its vast medicinal properties and health benefits. The Egyptians were the first to record the nourishing benefits some 6,000 years ago; even Cleopatra is said to have incorporated aloe into her daily skin regime! The Aloe plant is known for its thick, succulent leaves plumped with a watery gel-like substance. The leaves grow from the plant’s base in a rosette shape with flexible spines with jagged edges. Once matured, this plant can grow spiky flowers in shades of yellow, orange and red; however, many young plants can take years to produce a flower or, in some cases, never do. Looking to introduce an Aloe Vera plant to your growing plant family? Read on to learn more about how you can care for your Aloe at home. Where to buy aloe vera ireland How to care for your Aloe Vera Aloe has won over the hearts of many plant lovers for its hardiness and tolerance of infrequent watering. Here are some key care tips to keep your Aloe happy and healthy: Sun illustration Light- Aloe vera require lots of bright indirect sunlight. We recommend typically 6-8 hours per day. Your Aloe will be happiest on a sunny window ledge. Water illustrationWater- Aloe can handle drought conditions but prefers to be watered regularly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. If the plant is left dry too long, the leaves will wilt and pucker slightly. They also cannot tolerate standing in water so, ensure there are plenty of drainage holes in your plant to allow excess water to run out. To ensure drainage in a pot, you can use cactus potting soil or mix in some perlite or coarse sand and make your own mix. Thermostat illustrationTemperature-. Aloe vera gel is 96% water — which is why it can stand up to desert conditions. Your little Aloe enjoys an average temperature between 13°C.-18°C. From May to September, you can bring your Aloe outdoors but do bring it back inside in the evening or when temperatures begin to drop. In the winter months, keep away from areas with fluctuating temperatures and drafts. Feed- Aloe vera does not require high soil fertility. Feeding once a year, in the spring, with a houseplant fertiliser should be sufficient. Cleaning- Aloe vera plants are reasonably resistant to disease however indoor growers might find some issues with mealybugs and scale. Avoid overwatering your Aloe and keep the stems dust-free to prevent these issues from occurring. aloe vera uses Typical Uses of Aloe Vera Rated as one of the best air-purifying plants by Nasa's Clean Air Study, Aloe Vera works to remove harmful toxins and pollutants in the air and boost the room’s humidity. This can decrease the level of airborne diseases that can contribute to cold or flu-like symptoms. And, as if that wasn’t enough, this hardworking plant has been used as a medicinal plant for thousands because of the many healing powers contained within its leaves. Aloe Vera is proven to contain vitamins and enzymes that detoxify and support the immune system, lower cholesterol and blood sugar, digestion, provide a boost of vitamins, and help with acne and dehydrated skin. The gel within the plant is loaded with healing vitamins, antioxidants, and nutrients and can improve and soothe dry skin, burns and acne. It’s worth noting that while aloe vera is gentle, some people have been known to develop skin irritations and allergic reactions from it. The gel should never be used on cuts or burns that are quite serious. Always test a small amount on a tiny patch of skin before applying to the affected area and stop use if irritation occurs. aloe vera benefits Where to Keep Your Aloe Vera at Home This versatile plant is known to shine in any space within the home or workspace however, we believe it works best on a kitchen windowsill, where it acts as a self-regenerating first-aid kit. Because of its air-purifying properties, Aloes are also an excellent addition to bedrooms. It emits oxygen at night instead of during the day, giving the air around it a boost that could benefit your sleep! Stuck on ideas on how to pot your Aloe Vera?

What’s weird is that the aloe-killers among us might have the ‘greenest’ thumbs. I used to be in the green-thumbed aloe-killer camp, but after lots of research, trial and error I’ve unearthed several simple tricks to keep aloes happy. Whichever group you belong to, your aloes will thank you – and reward you – for reading this Aloe-Killer’s Guide to Thriving Aloe Vera Plants! Are you ready to help your aloes grow like mad and produce a bunch of aloe babies? Let’s dig in! Aloe Origins The first step to understanding your green friend is to learn its origins – its native habitat. You may have plucked your baby from the shelf of a home goods store, but that’s not what we’re talking about. Aloes originated in South Africa. Picture sunny, hot dry days and sandy, red soils cracked and thirsting for the infrequent blessing of rain. This environment is harsh for many people and plants, but this is exactly the context where aloes adapted to flourish. So, here is the first insight – aloes like it tough. They thrive on droughts, soak up simmering heat and don’t care for rich, fertile soils. This is where good-intentioned, hyper-involved plant parents get off to a bad start with aloes. Aloes just don’t want the kind of attentive care and common enjoyments that most other plants eat up. However, it’s important not to go extreme with the neglect either! Water Control is Key The leading cause of aloe demise is too much water. What throws aloe parents for a loop is that watering frequency is just a small part of the equation! Most of the advice that follows pertains to keeping water levels in your aloe’s potting mix exactly right. How Frequently Should I Water My Aloe? You’re going to love this answer: it depends! Not helpful, I know. I will unpack that. But! This is an important point here. It’s really key to water your aloe based on when it needs it and not based on a schedule. The better question to ask is: How do I know when my aloe wants water? 3 Signs Your Aloe Wants a Drink 1. The pinch test: Give a few of your aloe leaves a light squeeze. How firm does the leaf feel? Is there a little give when you pinch? Aloe leaves are basically water reservoirs, like the humps on a camel’s back. When the leaves lose some firmness, this indicates that the plant is using its water reserves and will want a drink sometime soon. Don’t wait until the aloe uses so much of its reserves that the leaves start to flop over or bend in the middle. To stick with the metaphor: water before you have floppy camel humps! At first the pinch test may be a difficult way to gauge the right moment to water, but it is the most accurate measure and you will get a feel for it after a few water cycles! 2. The finger test: Poke a finger into the soil a few inches down. Dry as a bone? Water immediately if the leaves look floppy. If the leaves are fine, wait a few days to give your aloe a period of complete drought, then water. 3. The looky-loo: When in doubt, pull it out! Wait, that sounds wrong… Um, if you are more of an eyes-on kind of person you can pull your aloe out of its pot to see if the soil is completely dry. This is also a great opportunity to see how the root system is doing (more on roots later). The Gist of Watering Air humidity, ambient temperature, pot, soil mix, root system and sunlight – all of these factors combine to impact how often an aloe is watered. As a general guide, aloes like water every one to three weeks in summer and less frequently in winter when aloes go dormant and do not put energy into new growth. Potting Mix: The Keeper of Water The potting medium your aloe lives in determines how much moisture is retained after a watering. Regular potting mix or garden soil holds onto water like a sponge. If you think back to its native habitat, that’s not what aloe wants! Aloes like a sandy potting mix with great drainage. Store-bought cactus or succulent mixes work quite well, but there may be room for improvement. If you notice the potting medium holding onto a lot of water for days, amend the soil with materials like coarse builder’s sand*, chicken grit, perlite or pumice to improve drainage and provide a lighter, airier space for aloe roots. Experiment with different potting mixes to find the combination that works best! * Avoid fine grain sand, like play sand 5 Keys to Picking the Perfect Pot Now here is a factor you may have overlooked: the material, size and shape of your pot plays a huge role in regulating water! 1. Plastic vs. Terracotta: If you live in a cool and humid climate you likely struggle with soil holding too much water. In this case, terracotta will make an excellent pot because its porous nature will wick away extra moisture sitting in the soil. If you live in a hot and dry environment where soil dries out fast, non-porous pots like plastic work best. This wide, shallow pot is perfect for aloes! 2. Go wide, not deep: Aloes have shallow root systems that like to stretch out and don’t do much downward exploration. Pick a pot that is wider than it is deep to match that growth habit. Deep pots are a one-way ticket to root rot town. If there are no roots at the bottom of the pot, the moisture in that soil will not be consumed by the aloe and bing-bam-boom you’ve got root rot! 3. Keep it cozy: Aloes like to be a bit pot-bound. The roots of your aloe should take up about half the pot, by volume to keep a cozy environment for the roots. This also helps prevent overwatering, because there is just a small amount of soil to hold on to moisture. 4. Let it drain: Drainage holes are key because pooling water will be the death of your aloe. I know, often the prettiest pots don’t have holes. But for the sake of your aloe, either drill a hole in the pot with a diamond-tipped drill bit or save it for another plant that likes wet soil. 5. Leave room for pups: With this guide in hand, there is no doubt you are going to have a happy aloe – and happy aloes like to have pups (little aloe babies)! Leave some space for aloe babies to emerge by choosing a pot that is a little wider than the current plant needs. Aloes Like it Hot – but Not Too Hot! Aloes are happiest in 55 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 27 degrees Celsius) and live natively in USDA hardiness zones 9 through 11. If you live in cooler climates, aloes will be happy indoors all year round. When the weather warms up you may be tempted to bring your aloe outside for a summer vacation. If you do bring your aloe outside, be sure to make it a gradual transition over the span of a week (starting your aloe off in a shadier and cooler location to mimic its indoor environment) and monitor how your aloe responds. A quick change in sunlight and temperature exposure from bringing your aloe outdoors can shock and kill your aloe: summer vacation can quickly turn into death in paradise. Your aloe’s final destination outdoors should provide bright indirect sun throughout the day, and potentially several hours of direct sun in the morning (depending on your aloe’s unique preferences).

Aloes absolutely love bright sun, but it can become too much of a good thing. Set up indoor aloes around south-facing windows, but don’t let the leaves directly touch the glass to keep them safe. Window glass can intensify sun beams and sizzle aloe leaves. Burnt aloe leaf tip If you notice your aloe leaves turn pale, orange or brown it’s likely that your aloe is getting too much sun — but don’t fret! There is a simple solution: relocate your aloe to a shadier spot. Jasmine Rosie from the gardenstead succulent group did exactly this when she noticed her aloes turning orange. Her aloe not only bounced back, but is doing better than ever! Jasmin Rosie's aloe. Photos courtesy of Jasmine Rosie. These pale-orange leaves indicate sun stress. Photo courtesy of Rita Kurgan. If you don’t have an abundance of light, that’s okay — I don’t either and I grow aloes anyway! You’ll notice that aloes with less-than-optimal light will grow leggier and floppier leaves, but the plant will continue to live and grow. If you want the best for your aloe, consider popping a grow light over it to make up for the lack of natural rays. Aloe’s Got 99 Problems but Fertilizer Ain’t One Perhaps after reading all this you’re starting to feel like aloes are a bit finicky. Thankfully, when it comes to fertilizing, aloes are low-key. Aloes don’t need any fertilizer, but if you want to give your aloe a jolt of energy to kick off the growing season, you can supply it with a phosphorus-heavy, water-based fertilizer at half strength once a year in spring (try saying that ten times fast!). A houseplant fertilizer with a ratio around 10-40-10 (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium) should do the trick. Say Aloe to My Little Friend! Forming a friendly relationship with your plants is all about understanding who they are and what they need. That’s why, at gardenstead, we believe that anyone armed with the right tips and an experimental mindset can keep their plants happy and thriving – and aloe is not an exception to that! Now that you’ve got all the dirt and details on how to make aloes happy, go forth and make friends with aloes! They are a good buddy when you get to know them and have lots to give back.

Despite their striking appearance, anthuriums are remarkably down-to-earth and can thrive quite happily without much fuss. Here’s a basic care checklist for anthuriums: Water when the top 2 inches of soil are dry Let your anthurium soak up some medium light Mist every 2-3 days in spring and summer Keep temperatures between 18 and 26°C Snip off any drooping flower stalks to boost growth All about anthuriums Also known as flamingo flowers or laceleaf plants, anthuriums (anthurium andraeanum) originate from warmer areas of the Caribbean and South America. Our resident red lady is Fleur, and her heart-shaped leaves help her steal the show in any room. Fleur is also joined by other colourful pals, Rachel (Anthurium ‘Lilli’), Felicity (Anthurium 'Spirit') and Lucy (Anthurium Zizou). In her native habitat, Fleur lounges around on the rainforest floor or hangs out on bigger plants, attracting insects with her lovely bright leaves – known as “spathes”. Indoors, Fleur is a dazzling yet durable houseplant. She also has spiked “flower” stalks rising from her leaves, which can last for up to three months. Anthurium in a navy ceramic pot on a side table Are anthuriums easy to care for? Although they might look high-maintenance, anthuriums actually have very simple care requirements. They come from humid parts of the world with warm temperatures, so they'll thrive if you can mirror these conditions. The only tricky thing with anthuriums is that they're toxic to both pets and people, especially children. Their sap can irritate your eyes and skin, and their pretty leaves are also poisonous if eaten. Keep your anthuriums in a safe place away from snooping pets or curious children. How often should I water my anthurium? The secret to a good anthurium beauty regime is to give them a moist environment. Check if the top two inches of soil is dry with a finger dip test and let your plant have a few sips until the soil is slightly wet. Don't drown it as soggy soil can wilt those luscious leaves. Always use a nursery pot with plenty of drainage holes. Misting your anthurium's leaves daily or giving it a sauna session in a steamy bathroom can help you keep the humidity high. Close-up of an anthurium flower How much light does my anthurium need? Keeping your plant's fantastic foliage looking radiant requires the right amount of light. In the jungle, anthuriums get a dappled dose of sunlight through the canopy. To mimic this at home, place your anthurium in a room that gets medium light. This helps bring out more blooms on their flower spikes. However, be sure to avoid direct sunlight as this can roast the leaves. Close-up of an anthurium flower What temperature is best for my anthurium? Anthuriums are used to toasty temperatures in their native habitat, but they'll be perfectly happy in your home if you're comfortable with the temperature. The ideal range is between 18 and 26°C, although if it gets colder than 10°C, this can halt growth. Should I repot my anthurium? Despite all their showy flower stalks, anthuriums are pretty slow growers and only need re-homing in a bigger pot every two or three years. This helps to keep their blooming cycle going and going. You might see small white root-like arms growing from the stems, but these aren't a sign that your plant needs repotting. They're called “aerial roots” and help the anthurium to grip onto trees and other plants. Simply snip these off if they're getting on your nerves, it won’t harm your plant. Anthurium in a light blue plastic pot on a side table Does my anthurium need any extra love? Although an anthurium's gorgeous flower spikes will keep blooming over and over for most of the year, they will eventually start to wilt at the end of their life cycle.

Looks The showy flower-like ‘spathes’ can be red, orange, pink or white, depending on the cultivar, and have a central spike, or spadix, that’s often cream or yellow. The leaves are lush, green and glossy. A few species are grown purely for their attractive foliage, boldly veined with silver. Compact but spectacular, anthuriums usually grow to about 30cm (1ft) tall. Likes Anthuriums like warmth (16–30°C/60–85°F), bright but indirect light and high humidity. They need an open, fast-draining, acidic compost mix, and rainwater or filtered water. Feeding with a weak orchid fertiliser will boost leaf and flower production. Dislikes The leaves will scorch in direct summer sunlight, while too little light will prevent flowering. Anthuriums can be damaged or killed by temperatures of 10°C (50°F) or lower, or by cold water – let it warm to room temperature before applying. Anthuriums dislike hard (alkaline) tap water – rainwater is best to keep them thriving. Leaving them in soggy compost for long periods will cause the roots to rot. Did you know? All parts of anthuriums are toxic, so wear gloves when handling them and keep plants out of reach of children and pets.\nHow to Grow and Care for Anthurium These tropical flowers are great candidates for growing indoors Anthurium, also called flamingo flowers, are known for their unique, bright red, green, and white colors. The genus consists of around 1,000 perennial plants native to Central America, northern South America, and the Caribbean. Though they can easily be grown outdoors in tropical climates, they are more often kept as houseplants or in greenhouses due to their specific care needs. Anthurium can bloom repeatedly for long periods; varieties are distinctive with heart-shaped waxy spathes (i.e., modified leaf around the flower) and red or yellow spikes. Growth rate is slow or moderate and dependent on ample light but susceptible to sunburn. Many anthuriums are climbers, and all need high humidity and warmth to thrive. Anthurium is toxic to both humans and pets.12 Common Names Anthurium, tailflower, flamingo flower, laceleaf Botanical Name Anthurium spp. Family Araceae Plant Type Herbaceous, perennial Mature Size 12-18 in. tall, 9- to 12-inch wide Sun Exposure Partial Soil Type Well-drained Soil pH Acidic Bloom Time Spring, summer, fall, winter Flower Color Red, pink, white Hardiness Zones 11-12 (USDA) Native Area Central America, South America, Caribbean Toxicity Toxic to humans and pets12 Anthurium Care Plant in a well-draining pot with a 50-50 mix of orchid and houseplant potting media. Place anthurium in a warm, brightly lit room but out of direct light. An area with high humidity such as a bathroom is a good choice. Allow anthurium's soil to dry out between waterings. Feed weekly during the growing season with a diluted liquid houseplant fertilizer. Provide a stake or small trellis to support plants with aerial roots. Many anthurium plants are epiphytic in natural settings—they grow on other plants instead of in soil. If leaves and flowers tend to fall over, give the plant a stake or small trellis to climb on. vase of anthurium flowers Credit: The Spruce / Letícia Almeida closeup of anthurium plant closeup of an anthurium bud closeup of anthurium leaves Light Anthuriums prefer sun over shade, but too much direct light can scorch the leaves. Inadequate light causes poor growth and few flowers. The ideal location for your plant provides six hours of bright, indirect sunlight daily. Where to Put Anthurium Place anthurium in or near a south- or west-facing window but not in the direct line of the sun's rays. Pull a sheer curtain between the plant and the window, or set it near but not in the window so it gets maximum bright, indirect light. Soil Potting material needs to be coarse and drain well to provide adequate air circulation around the roots. Mosses, cocoa coir, or a 50-50 combination of orchid and houseplant potting medium make a good mix. You can also add sand and peat moss to orchid mix for a coarse well-draining soil. Water Keep soil slightly moist and never allow it to dry out completely. Water indoor plants about once a week or when the top of the soil is dry to the touch. Water your plant until it runs from the pot's drainage holes but do not leave it to sit in water—anthuriums are vulnerable to root rot. Grown outdoors, plants may need water every two to three days. Temperature and Humidity All species are native to the tropics, and prefer high humidity and temperatures between 65°F and 85°F. These plants can be grown outside in zones 11 to 12. They'll be damaged in temperatures below 60°F, and die off when temperatures dip to 40°F. In dry climates or during dry winter months, set it on a pebble tray to keep humidity levels high. You may find it necessary to run a humidifier constantly during dry months. Fertilizer Feed a high phosphorus liquid fertilizer throughout the growing period. Dilute to 1/4 strength and feed every week. Phosphorus-rich fertilizer encourages your anthurium to flower. Dusting Besides watering, the care task your anthurium will need most often is dusting because it interferes with photosynthesis. Use a microfiber cloth to gently wipe the leaves clean. Types of Anthurium A. andreanum: Common species; heart-shaped leaves that grow a little over 1 foot with red, white, pink, and variegated flowers; distinguished by a straight flower spike A. scherzerianum: Common species; most forgiving of anthuriums, features a curling orange flower spike and arrow-shaped leaves A. crystallinum: Less common species; deep green, velvety leaves with pronounced white ribs; leaves grow around 2 feet across A. faustomirandae: Less common species; monster-sized plant with cardboard-stiff leaves, grows over 5 feet; almost exclusively a greenhouse plant Pruning Remove older leaves and flowers as they fade and die back. Pinch them off at the base or use a sterile hand pruner to cut them from the main stem. Pruning to shape your plant can be done any time during the year. Remove extra tall stems and any that grow at odd angles. Always leave at least three to four leaves on the plant. Damaged leaves can be partially removed with the bad parts cut out. If your plant has just a few leaves it's better to keep a partial leaf until a new one emerges. Propagating Anthurium Anthuriums are propagated using side shoots (pups) and stem cuttings, though side shoots are the fastest and safest method. Starting with seed, plants take four years to mature to flowering stage so this method is not practical for home growers. You'll need a clean pot, fresh well-draining soil, and a sharp, sterilized knife or pruners. Stem cuttings require removing the top of the main stem and should be undertaken only when one or more new buds can be left on the main stem. Here's how to propagate anthuriums with side shoots: Find a side shoot: Look for a well developed side shoot growing off the main stem. Ideally it will have at least one mature leaf and several aerial roots that can be easily removed along with the side shoot. Cut it: Use your sterile, sharp implement to remove the side shoot making a clean straight cut where it joins the main stem. Prepare the container: Choose a pot wide and deep enough to accommodate the main stem and roots and fill it 1/3 full with potting mix. Set the cutting: Set the side shoot on top and fill in to cover the aerial roots, keeping the junction of any leaves or new leaf buds above soil level. Care for the cutting: Water thoroughly and place in a warm spot that receives indirect light. New growth appears in about four to six weeks. Potting and Repotting Anthurium Repot your anthurium every two years or so. Transfer the plant to a pot that is no more than two inches larger than the old one in diameter. Pots made of plastic, ceramic and terracotta are all good choices. Keep in mind that terracotta tends to dry out more quickly than plastic and ceramic. To repot an anthurium, fill the new pot with about 1/3 potting mix, then set the plant onto the soil and lightly pack additional soil around the base, up to the level the plant was buried in its old pot. Overwintering Indoor anthuriums shouldn't need any special care in winter. It will be getting less light in its window and be doing less growing, so it can probably go longer between waterings. Anthurium will not survive outside in non-tropical zones over winter. If your plant lives outside bring it in as soon as the temperature drops below 60°F. Place your plant close to a sunny window with high humidity and temperatures that hover around 75°F. A bathroom environment is perfect. Common Pests These plants are subject to the same pests that commonly affect most houseplants: mealybugs, spider mites, whiteflies, and scale.3 Aphids leave distorted mottled leaves over time. Ants are a also sign of aphid infestation and feed on the aphid's sticky residue.4 Spider mites, thrips, and mealybugs also feed on new growth causing yellow stippling and mottled leaves. Stubborn insects may respond to horticultural soap or oil sprays, which are natural and don't harm the plant. Water Solution You can often control insects naturally with blasts of water, which dislodge and drown the pests. Place the plant in the sink and spray the leaves clean. How to Get Anthurium to Bloom Anthuriums are picky, but their uniquely beautiful flowers make them worth the extra effort. Anthuriums grown indoors in ideal conditions often bloom year round. How Long Does Anthurium Bloom? Each anthurium flower lasts between two and three months. What Do Anthurium Flowers Look and Smell Like? Anthurium flowers are actually modified leaves called spathes. They appear atop single spikes emerging from a central stem and each spathe has a pencil-like structure in its center where tiny white, red, or yellow flowers appear. Spathes on most anthuriums grown as houseplants are red but varieties include white, pink, purple, and bicolors. The spathes are heart shaped and waxy with some types featuring a slightly crinkled appearance. Not all anthuriums smell good, but those that are fragrant can range from sweet and fruity to outright unpleasant. How to Keep Anthurium Blooming Most anthuriums are purchased as houseplants already in bloom. To keep it blooming, you'll have to continue to meet the perfect conditions it was getting in a greenhouse. To keep anthurium blooming, you'll need to give it plenty of light, humidity, and fertilizer. If it's not in a bathroom window, try adding a humidifier. Feed it weekly with a diluted liquid fertilizer that's high in phosphorus. If you still aren't getting flowers, give it more light and check the plant isn't rootbound and in need of repotting. Deadheading Anthurium Flowers Leave anthurium flowers on the stems until they start to turn brown. Then use a sharp, sterile cutting tool to remove the entire flower spike where it emerges from the main stem. Meeting Ideal Conditions Your anthurium will only bloom indoors in ideal care conditions. To help meet its necessary conditions, consider getting a humidifier and grow light for it (we've tested dozens and have found the best of each). Common Problems With Anthurium This plant has some special needs, but once you find a good spot and nail down a routine, anthurium is an easy plant to keep. Yellowing Leaves Too much direct sunlight may cause anthurium leaves to turn yellow. Bleached and brown tips also indicate too much light. Move the plant a little further away from the window. Yellowing leaves can also result from bacterial wilt.5 Floppy Leaves Rhizoctonia is a fungus of roots and lower stems. It causes young, delicate stems to become weak and floppy and is usually due to overwatering\nAnthuriums Quick Anthurium Facts: Botanical name - Anthurium andraeanum Height - 1.0 to 1.5 feet (30.5 to 45.7 cm) Spread - .75 to 1.0 feet (22.9 to 30.5 cm) Sun exposure - Bright, indirect Soil requirements - Rich and well-draining Hardiness zones - 11 to 12 When to plant - Year-round About Anthurium The anthurium is a tropical native grown mostly as a houseplant in North America’s cooler areas and as a landscaping plant in USDA zones 10 or higher. Common names for anthurium include flamingo flower, flamingo lily, painter’s palette, and tailflower. Plant lovers like its shiny, dark green leaves, bright flower spathes, and low maintenance needs when grown indoors. Known for its striking spathes and shiny leaves, anthurium is grown most often as a houseplant and cut flower. What looks to be the flower of the anthurium is actually a spathe, a modified leaf that surrounds the spadix. On the spadix are the small, tightly clustered flowers. The spathe is large, waxy, and usually bright red. You can now find varieties with white, salmon, pink, or even greenish spathes. Anthurium produces long-lasting flowers and blooms throughout the year. How to Care For Anthurium Plants Anthurium plant care is fairly easy, which is one reason it is a popular houseplant. It’s not for every home, though, as anthurium is highly toxic to humans and pets. If you have pets or small children, reconsider growing anthurium, or keep it out of reach. Anthurium Water Requirements Let your anthurium’s soil or potting mix dry out between waterings. Only water an anthurium when the soil is dry to the touch. The plant is susceptible to root rot, so too much water can cause the roots to die. The soil should be lightly moist and drain very well for the best results. Anthurium also thrives best in humid conditions. If your home is dry, use a pebble tray under the planter or mist the entire plant with water regularly. Don’t overwater, but don’t allow the plant to become too dry in a pot, either. This will slow down its growth making the rootball difficult to re-wet. If the rootball becomes too dry in the pot, soak the entire pot for an hour to rehydrate it. Anthurium Light Needs The best light for anthurium plants is bright and indirect. Place it by a bright window with another plant or sheer curtains to filter the light. It will tolerate low light but will not bloom as prolifically. Too much direct light can scorch the leaves. Soil for Anthurium Plants Good anthurium care includes using a potting mix that’s loose and drains very well. In its native range, anthurium grows epiphytically without soil, so a very loose potting mix is important. A good blend is half potting mix and half perlite. Another option is a combination of cactus and orchid soil mix. Anthurium Fertilizer You can easily get away with never fertilizing an anthurium plant and it will still bloom, but to get more flowers, use a standard fertilizer once every few months diluted to quarter strength. For the best blooms, use a fertilizer that has a higher phosphorus number (the middle number on fertilizer). If you live in a climate where anthurium can grow outdoors, plant it in a well-drained location. Anthurium plants don’t like continually moist soil. Pruning & Repotting Anthurium Anthurium pruning requirements are minimal. To encourage blooms, you can trim off spent flowers and spathes. It will not grow too quickly but can benefit from transplanting to a bigger container every two to three years. If the plant is growing out of the container, it’s time to repot. Choose a new container that is about 20% bigger than the current one. Problems, Pests & Diseases There are few issues associated with growing anthurium. The most common problem is root rot or a fungal infection due either to overwatering or to soil that doesn’t drain well and retains too much water. You can avoid these problems by using the right potting mix and not overwatering. Anthurium pests are minimal, but look for spider mites, scale, white fly, and mealy bugs. Use a mild insecticidal soap or gently swab the affected area with a soft cloth or cotton soaked with rubbing alcohol. Anthurium Propagation Tips Anthurium is easy to propagate by division. When repotting a plant, remove a clump of fleshy roots with at least one point of growth, and repot in a separate container. If it’s not time to repot an anthurium and you don’t want to uproot it, you can also take a cutting. Plant your cutting in potting mix and keep it moist or place it in water. Change out the water every few days. Be patient, as it can take six to eight weeks to see root growth. Types of Anthurium Like many other popular tropical houseplants, it’s fun to seek out unique types and varieties of anthurium. The most common types have a bright red or pink spathe, but you can find newer varieties in other colors. Some other unique species or cultivars to search for include: Anthurium \"Black Beauty\" This cultivar has dark, glossy, nearly black spathes. Anthurium \"Centennial\" Developed in Hawaii, this variety has white spathes with green veining. Anthurium scherzerianum This species looks very similar to Anthurium andraeanum except for its spadix, which is curled. Anthurium clidemioides This species of anthurium has unique textured foliage. Anthurium crystallium This one is also desirable for its unique foliage. The leaves are veined with white and have a crystal-like, shiny texture. Anthurium care indoors is simple, which makes this striking specimen a popular houseplant. Only grow anthurium outdoors if you are in a hot, sub-tropical or tropical climate. An anthurium growing in your home or garden will reward you with wonderful, long lasting flowers."

       "'Aechmea Fasciata: Urn Plant, Vase Plant Care Tips Are you ready to add a touch of tropical pizazz to your indoor garden? Look no further than the stunning Aechmea fasciata, which may soon become your favorite bromeliad. These plant care tips will help keep yours healthy and looking good. Bromeliads have rocked my world for many years, so I share the love today. The Aechmea fasciata, with its patterned silver foliage and pink flower, makes a great houseplant and will have beginning gardeners singing “green thumb” in no time. I started my horticultural career as an interior landscape technician, maintaining plants in lobbies, malls, offices, and hotels. Granted, these aren’t the most welcoming environments for flowering plants native to the tropics and the subtropics, but bromeliads held their own. This Aechmea was commonly used, and their pink blooms were long-lasting. Botanical Name: Aechmea fasciata Common Names: Vase Plant, Silver Vase Plant, Urn PlantAechmea Fasciata Plant Care Tips Two aechmea bromeliad plants with pink flowers sit side by side. The silvery patterned foliage makes this plant distinctive. Looking at the plant on the left, you can see inside the central tank that collects water. It’s also called a vase, urn, or cup. Light Requirements Aechmea plants like bright light, near an east or west window is good. They need this exposure to bring out the variegation in their foliage and to have the small flowers open up. Keep them out of hot windows to avoid prolonged exposure to direct sun because they’ll burn. They’ll do okay in lower light for a few weeks, but to grow them for the long haul and have them produce pups (baby plants), bright indirect light is key. Watering Aechmeas are epiphytes and in nature, grow attached to other plants and even rocks. The roots are primarily for anchoring. They get the moisture and nutrients they need through their foliage. Never keep them soggy or let them sit directly in water, as this leads to root rot. It’s best to keep the vase, cup, urn, or tank (the center where the flower arises out) 1/4 full of water. Flush it out with fresh water every 1-2 months to avoid any build-up of bacteria. I’ve found that the center of the plant will begin to rot over time if it’s kept full, especially in the winter months. Keep even less water in the central cup if you have low light and/or cool temperatures. I let the cup dry for two to seven days before refilling it with a little water. My situation is a bit different: I live in the Arizona desert and in the low-humidity months (there are quite a few!) I keep the tank about half full. If you have hard water, consider using purified or distilled water. I use filtered water for all my indoor plants. I have a tankless R/O water filtration system that runs through my kitchen faucet; it has a re-mineralization cartridge that puts the good minerals back in. Because moisture is collected through their leaves, Aechmeas appreciate spraying or misting once or twice a week. I’ve had this sprayer for over three years, and it still works like a charm. I water the growing medium every 1-2 months, depending on the temperatures and the season. Like all houseplants, you want to water less in the late fall through winter. An aechmea bromelaid plant with a large pink flower & a guzmania bromeliad plant sit side by side. My Aechmea next to a Neoregelia, another fine type of bromeliad. Humidity/Temperature As I say about all houseplants, if your house is comfortable temperature-wise for you, then your Aechema will do just fine. You want to avoid putting it in any areas with cold or hot drafts. Bromeliads are native to the subtropics and the tropics (locations with high humidity) but handle the lack of humidity in our homes and offices just fine. I have this humidity meter in my dining room. It’s inexpensive but does the trick and still works fine after a few years. I run my Canopy humidifiers when the humidity reads low, often in the Arizona desert! Feeding/Fertilizing Aechmeas, like other bromeliads, get their nutrients from matter that falls on them from plants growing above. The roots serve the purpose of anchoring them onto whatever they’re growing on – trees, rocks, etc. For this reason, it’s best to spray the fertilizer onto the foliage and the growing medium’s surface. I don’t feed bromeliads because I feel they really don’t need it. If your Aechmea does, use an all-purpose orchid food, diluted to 1/2 strength, or a bromeliad fertilizer. Just be sure not to get too much in the tank because the salts in the fertilizer build up and cause burn. Feed in the spring or summer, once or twice a year. Growing Mix Aechmeas are epiphytes, so they need a mix that drains very well. They’ll grow fine in orchid bark or orchid mix. I’ve also planted them in 1/2 coco chips and 1/2 coco coir, a more sustainable replacement for peat moss. Repotting Aechmeas don’t have extensive root systems, so yours most likely will never need to be repotted. If you need to, spring, summer, and early fall are the best times. You may choose to repot the pups at some point – more on that below. Propagation/Aechmea Pups The mother plant eventually dies after flowering (sad but true), which is part of their life cycle. Pups or babies (new plants) will appear at the mother’s base, so a part of her lives on. Happy ending! Those pups are one way to propagate Aechmeas. You can cut away the foliage of the mother plant after it’s completely dried and dead, leaving the pups to grow in that same pot. Or, you can carefully remove the pups after reaching 4-6″ and put them in a new pot. Another option is to mount them on driftwood or bark. It can take a bromeliad pup 3-5 years to flower. So, don’t expect it to happen the next year! The other way to propagate bromeliads is by seed. Close up of the urn vase or cup of an aechmea bromeliad plant with a pink flower. Here’s a close-up so you can see the small violet flower buds coming off the stalk. Safe For Pets I haven’t heard anything about these being toxic to cats or dogs. According to the ASPCA, Guzmania plants (a bromeliad relative) are considered non-toxic for cats and dogs. However, some kitties like to chew on their crunchy leaves, so if yours does, you might want to keep your eye on that. It won’t poison them, but it could make them sick. The Guzmania is a popular bromeliad sold in places like Trader Joe’s, Home Depot, Lowes, etc. Get Guzmanina care & growing tips here. Aechmea Flower The large stalk with pink bracts produces small violet flowers. You can see them in the photo above. When buying an Aechmea, I look inside to ensure the violet flowers aren’t open. If the flowers are fully open, yours won’t last as long. The colorful flower head should last and look good for up to 4 months. After it dies, cut it off down to the tank’s base. Once yours has flowered, the mother plant eventually dies. You can read more on bromeliad flowers here.\\nUrn plant, also known as silver vase, is an epiphytic plant known for its elegantly arcing leaves striped with silvery gray and its showy pink bract, which resembles a large flower. However, this bract actually holds many small purple, red, or blue flowers that will appear at the height of the plant\\'s bloom. This member of the bromeliad family is native to the warm, humid climate of Brazil but makes an excellent indoor plant in temperate regions. Urn plant grows best with partial sunlight, moist but well-drained soil, and temperatures between 60°F and 85°F. Here\\'s how to care for urn plants in your home. Common Name: Urn plant, silver vase Botanical Name: Aechmea fasciata Family: Bromeliaceae Plant Type: Epiphyte Mature Size: 1-3 ft. tall and wide Sun Exposure: Partial Soil Type: Moist, well-drained Soil pH: Acid, Alkaline, Neutral Bloom Time: Blooms once; timing varies Flower Color: Pink bract with blue, purple, or red flowers Hardiness Zones: 10-11 (USDA) Native Area: Brazil Urn Plant Care Put in a place with bright, indirect light. Plant in moist, well-drained potting mix. Keep the soil consistently moist and water the center cup. Feed monthly during the growing season. Want more gardening tips? Sign up for our free gardening newsletter for our best-growing tips, troubleshooting hacks, and more! Light Give your urn plant plenty of bright, indirect light. This plant naturally grows below the tree canopy\\'s shade in its native tropical forests. Keep the plant out of direct sun. Soil Use a light, well-drained potting mix that holds moisture. Since urn plant is an epiphytic plant, it uses its roots to hold onto tree branches rather than growing in soil. You can purchase pre-made mixes designed for bromeliads or make your own by combining equal parts peat moss or coconut coir, perlite, and finely shredded pine bark or orchid bark. Water Allow your urn plant\\'s soil to dry out before each watering. Instead of watering on a regular schedule, check soil moisture often and water based on that. However, it\\'s important to keep the central cup-shaped opening formed by the plant\\'s leaves at least half full of water at all times. Flush and replace the water every few weeks. Temperature and Humidity Urn plant grows best in conditions with temperatures between 60°F and 80°F and humidity between 40 and 50 percent. Plants can tolerate higher temperatures with adequate water and humidity. Fertilizer Urn plant doesn\\'t necessarily require fertilizer, but you can use a balanced liquid houseplant fertilizer diluted to half strength when watering its roots during the spring and summer. Take care not to add fertilizer to the water you pour into the central cup. Some gardeners choose to use fertilizers designed for orchids or air plants. Propagating Urn Plant Urn plant can only be propagated when offsets, or baby plants, appear once a mature plant has bloomed. Offsets will grow around the base of the mother plant after the inflorescence has appeared. You can remove them to propagate separately or simply leave the offsets in place as the mother plant dies back. If you decide to divide the offsets, let them grow as large as possible before removing them so they have the best chance of surviving independently. Gather a clean, sharp knife or shears, rooting hormone powder, fresh potting mix, and a small plant pot for each offset. Examine the mother plant and clear away an inch or two of soil around the base. You should be able to see where the pups connect to the main stem slightly below the soil surface. Use the knife to remove the offset, cutting straight down at the base and getting as close to the mother plant as possible. It\\'s okay if the cutting hasn\\'t yet developed any roots of its own. Fill a plant pot with fresh potting mix and water lightly to moisten it. Make a hole a few inches deep in the soil with your finger. Dip the base of the offset in rooting hormone and plant it in the hole, only pressing down the soil lightly to keep the cutting in place. Put the cutting in a warm place that gets bright, indirect light. Keep the soil evenly moist and the central cup filled with water. Common Pests & Plant Diseases Urn plant isn\\'t particularly susceptible to pests or diseases, but it can fall prey to common sucking insects like mealybugs and scale. Root rot, a fungal issue caused by overly wet soil, may affect plants that aren\\'t allowed to dry out between waterings. How to Get Urn Plant to Bloom An urn plant that isn\\'t blooming may simply be immature. Generally, plants must be at least three years old before they bloom, and they must be grown under the proper conditions. A mature plant may not bloom if temperatures are too consistent. The plant needs cooler temperatures to grow dormant, after which it may produce an inflorescence. In the winter, keep the plant in a cool place and cut back on watering. You can also try stimulating your urn plant to bloom by emptying the central cup and placing the plant in an airtight, clear plastic bag with an apple for about a week. You may be more likely to see the inflorescence appear in the two to three months after removing the bag. Common Problems With Urn Plant Flower Not Reblooming An urn plant\\'s colorful inflorescence can last for weeks or months. However, these plants only bloom once in their lifetime. Once the inflorescence dies back, it won\\'t regrow. For future blooms, follow the instructions above to propagate offsets into new plants. Leaves Turning Yellow Yellow leaves are a common sign of overwatering your urn plant. A plant that\\'s not getting enough light may also display yellow leaves. Browning Tips Overly dry conditions can cause the tips of your urn plant\\'s leaves to brown. Too much direct sunlight can also cause brown spots on leaves. FAQ How tall do urn plants grow? Urn plants can grow between one and three feet tall. How often do urn plants bloom? Urn plants will only bloom once in their lifetime. Can urn plant grow indoors? Yes, urn plant makes an excellent houseplant with the proper care and conditions.\\nUrn Plant Care: How To Grow Urn Plant Houseplants Aechmea fasciata, the urn plant bromeliad, comes to us from the South American rainforests. It is an epiphyte, commonly called an air plant, and in the wild it grows on other plants where it receives moisture from heavy rains and nutrients from decaying debris around its roots. This is important to urn plant care in your home as you will try to mimic its natural conditions. Tips for Urn Plant Care In the rainforests, rainwater gathers in the stiff rosette of leaves that form the urn. Plant care in the home consists of keeping the center filled with water at all times. For a healthy plant, the water should be emptied and refilled once a week to prevent stagnation. Watch out for dry brown edges of the leaves. It\\'s a sign of dehydration in your urn plant. Care should also be taken with the soil. Keep it moist, but don\\'t overwater. Soggy soil will cause rot at the base of your urn plant bromeliad. You can fertilize your urn plant bromeliad by misting with a weak foliar spray or by adding a half strength solution to the water at its center once a month. If you live in a hardiness zone of 10b or 11, you can grow urn plants outside as long as you keep them well watered. They aren\\'t fussy about soil when grown outdoors, but caring for an urn plant indoor is a bit different. Once again, look at how they grow in the wild. Silt, decaying debris and bits of leaf and bark cling to and build up around the roots of the epiphyte. In your chosen pot at home, you should try to duplicate this soft, well aerated soil. Orchid potting mix is ideal for this or, if you prefer to mix your own, mix peat moss, perlite, and finely shredded pine bark in equal parts. You need a soil that remains light and well aerated so the roots can easily spread. Urn plants prefer bright light, but not direct sun and can suffer scorched leaves if moved too quickly from indoors to out during the summer months. They do best in temperatures between 65 and 75 degrees F. (12-24 C.), although they can tolerate higher with regular misting. How to Get an Urn Plant to Bloom Almost everyone who tries to grow urn plants wants them to bloom. Those colorful, long lasting bracts rising from the center of the plant are the ultimate reward in caring for an urn plant. A plant must be at least three years old before it produces a flower stem. One of the most common complaints of gardeners is the failure of bracts to grow. Urn plants need good light and plenty of it for bract production. If light isn\\'t the problem, then it may be a lack of ethylene gas. To encourage blooming, try placing a quartered apple on top of the soil and using a plastic bag to cover both pot and urn plant. Bromeliad plants bloom only once before they die, but don\\'t despair. They leave several lovely gifts behind. Once the bract turns brown, continue caring for your urn plant as before even as the leaves turn brown and die. Beneath the dying leaves you\\'ll find two or more \"pups\"--baby urn plants. Allow these pups to grow in place until they are 6 inches (15 cm.) tall which usually takes five or six months, and then transfer them to pots of their own.\\nAechmea fasciata: Growing Guidelines This article provides information on the specific growing guidelines for Aechmea fasciata bromeliads. Light: Bright light from an east or west window. Temperature: In summer, plants enjoy moving outdoors, provided temperatures range between 70 to 85 degrees F (21 to 30 degrees C). In the fall, winter and early spring, average room temperature should be between 65 to 75 degrees F (18 to 24 degrees C). Fertilizer: In the summer, feed monthly with a liquid plant food diluted to half the normal strength. Spray it on the leaves and fertilize the roots. In the winter, feed plants every other month. Water: Flush the water in the reservoir regularly, at least every 10 days. Lightly water the roots weekly in the summer, and less often in the winter. Do not allow the roots to dry out completely in any season. Soil: Orchid potting soil or a bromeliad mix work great! For more information on soil, take a look at this bromeliad soil article. Repotting: Repot young plants annually in the spring, as needed, until they fill an 8-inch pot. Longevity: Plants mature in 3 to 4 years. Propagation: Divide and repot offsets when they are 4 to 6 months old and at least 6 in (15 cm) tall. For more information on bromeliad propagation, get our free Guide to Bromeliad Pups. Selections: In addition to the green-leafed form, ‘Purpurea’ features leaves blushed with maroon, and ‘Variegata’ has creamy longitudinal stripes on the leaves. Display Tips: Grow Aechmea fasciata in its own pot near plants with lush green foliage, such as ferns or flowering houseplants that need abundant light. Young pups can be mounted on a piece of wood for one season.'"

         "Why Your Peace Lily Won’t Bloom & Tips To Make It Flower Many houseplant parents ask us how to make a peace lily bloom. The peace lily is a very common houseplant that’s only outdoor-hardy in USDA zones 10-11, but the plant thrives in low-light situations, making it perfect for indoor office decor. While the glossy, green leaves are attractive, most gardeners buy the plant for its inflorescence. The cupped, creamy white, spathe enfolds the spadix and enhances the greenery. But once the bloom is finished, can you make it bloom again? Peace lily flowering takes quite a bit of patience, and the right conditions. Peace Lily Flowering Stages In a commercial setting, peace lilies are grown in carefully controlled environments. This is to ensure that the plants are flowering by the time they’re displayed for purchase. This member of the Arum family doesn’t produce an actual flower but instead a flower-like modified leaf, the spathe. A blooming peace lily is beautiful and getting the plant to produce the spathe again is a gardener’s challenge. The spathe is long-lasting but will eventually turn green and then brown when it is done. During its life cycle, the plant buds, blooms, sets seed, then the flower wilts. When Does a Peace Lily Bloom? Purchased peace lilies have been forced to bloom. Professional growers treat the plant with gibberellic acid. Known as GA in the trade, this substance is a plant hormone that drives blooming, among other things. It is a natural product derived from the Gibberella fujikuroi fungus that occurs on rice plants. After spraying the plant with GA, the flower will be produced around 70 days later. The plants generally bloom in mid-spring, around April, with the flower lasting over a month. How Often Does a Peace Lily Bloom? Peace lilies produce blooms once the growing season begins and may occasionally produce a flower in early fall. Getting 2 annual blooms requires exacting conditions that mimic those of their native range in the tropical forests of Columbia and Venezuela. The plant must have the perfect light, proper temperatures and humidity to form even 1 flower. Why Is My Peace Lily Not Flowering? A peace lily not flowering is a very common occurrence; the internet is flooded with searches about the peace lily not blooming. Once the spathe fades and it is cut away from the plant, the peace lily is often kept just as a foliage plant, never to bloom again. Indoor home conditions are rarely optimal for generating another bloom, but structured changes to the environment or growing the plant in a controlled area can force it to flower. Not Enough Light Peace lilies (Spathyphyllum) are understory plants that receive filtered light through the tree canopy. They like low light but too little light will prevent the plant from blooming. Most of the time it thrives in light as low as 20 candles, but when you want it to bloom, this amount must be increased. The plant will respond to the short day-long-night photoperiod of fall and winter by forming a bud. But, except a few cultivars, these plants will not form buds during the long-day-short night part of the year. Wrong Time of Year This photoperiodism response is typical of many plants. Light changes are sensed by photoreceptors that in turn cause hormonal changes. Auxins are plant hormones that drive new growth. They are what informs the plant that it is time to bloom. Peace lily is a short-day response plant. So plants will begin to form buds in the cooler season and fully flower when the days become longer. Plant Isn’t Old Enough A peace lily must be several years old before it will flower. While studies have shown younger plants produce more flowers, very old plants may simply stop producing blooms. Young plants will generally produce a bloom in about 15 months in perfect conditions. How to Make a Peace Lily Bloom Peace lily plants respond not only to light changes, but to temperature and humidity levels. To encourage the plant to bloom, move it to a slightly brighter location. Plants that undergo a chilling period of 54 degrees Fahrenheit (12 C) for a few weeks will flower earlier than those in warmer temperatures. The optimal average temperature year round is 72 F (22 C). The plants also enjoy significant humidity. In homes with central heating, they often do not receive enough ambient moisture. Mist the leaves daily or place the container on a saucer filled with pebbles and water. This will evaporate and increase the humidity around the plant. The plant does not need much fertilizer but the chance of a bloom increases with an application of balanced fertilizer every 6 to 8 weeks during the growing season. Removing spent flowers will encourage plants to rebloom. Avoid placing the plant near drafts and allow it to become pot bound. With a little luck, the plant will bloom again."

Whether you’re a seasoned plant parent or someone who’s just managed to keep a cactus alive, aloe vera is your new low-maintenance best friend. Not only does it look cool with its spiky green leaves, but it moonlights as a natural remedy for life’s little burns and boo-boos. From choosing the perfect sunny windowsill to knowing when (and when not) to water, we’re here to make sure your aloe thrives, not just survives. Let’s get growing! About Aloe Vera Aloe vera is a succulent plant species of the genus Aloe. The plant is stemless or short-stemmed with thick, greenish, fleshy leaves that fan out from the plant’s central stem. The margin of the leaf is serrated with small teeth. Before you buy an aloe, note that you’ll need a location that offers bright, indirect sunlight (or artificial sunlight). Direct sunlight can dry out the plant too much and turn its fleshy leaves yellow, so you may need to water more often if your aloe lives in an exceedingly sunny spot. Keep the aloe vera plant in a pot near a kitchen window for periodic use. WARNING: The gel from aloe vera leaves can be used topically but should NOT be eaten by people or pets. It can cause unpleasant symptoms such as nausea or indigestion and may even be toxic in larger quantities. Read Next Aloe Vera: A Self-Regenerating First-Aid Kit Top Succulent Plants for the Home Houseplant Care Guide Planting Before Planting Aloe Vera It’s important to choose the right type of container. A pot made from terra-cotta or similar porous material is recommended, as it will allow the soil to dry thoroughly between waterings and will also be heavy enough to keep the plant from tipping over. A plastic or glazed pot may also be used, though these will hold more moisture. When choosing a container, pick one with at least one drainage hole in the bottom. This is key, as the hole will allow excess water to drain out. Aloe vera plants are hardy, but a lack of proper drainage can cause rot and wilting, which is easily the most common cause of death for this plant. Select a container that’s about as wide as it is deep. If your aloe plant has a stem, choose a container deep enough to plant the entire stem under the soil. Aloe vera plants are succulents, so use a well-draining potting mix, such as those made for cacti and succulents. Do not use gardening soil. A good mix should contain perlite, lava rock, chunks of bark, or all three. A layer of gravel, clay balls, or any other drainage material in the bottom of the pot is not necessary. This only takes up space that the roots could otherwise be using. A drainage hole is drainage enough! (Optional) To encourage your aloe to put out new roots after planting, dust the stem of the plant with a rooting hormone powder. Rooting hormone can be found at a local garden center or hardware store or bought online. how to care for aloe vera infographic How to Plant (or Repot) an Aloe Vera Plant If your aloe plant has grown leggy, has gotten too large, or simply needs an upgrade, it’s time to repot it. Here’s how: Prepare your pot. After giving the new pot a quick rinse (or a good scrub if it’s a pot you’ve used before) and letting it dry thoroughly, place a small piece of screen over the drainage hole; this will keep the soil from falling out the bottom and will allow water to drain properly. A doubled-up piece of paper towel or newspaper can also work in a pinch, though these will break down over time. Prepare your plant. Remove the aloe vera plant from its current pot and brush away any excess dirt from the roots, being careful not to damage the roots. If your plant has any pups, remove them now. (See “Care” below for instructions on removing and potting pups.) If your plant has a very long, spindly stem that won’t fit in the pot, it is possible to trim the stem off partially. Note that this is risky and could kill the plant. To trim the stem: Cut off part of the stem, leaving as much as possible on the plant. Next, place the bare plant in a warm area that gets indirect light. After several days, a callus will form over the wound. At this point, continue with the repotting instructions below. Plant your plant. Fill the pot about a third of the way with a well-draining potting mix, then place your plant in the soil. Continue filling in the soil around the plant, bearing in mind that you should leave at least 3/4 of an inch of space between the top of the soil and the rim of the pot. The bottom leaves of the aloe plant should rest just above the soil, too. Do not water after planting. Ignore your plant (temporarily). After you’ve placed your aloe in its new pot, don’t water it for at least a week. This will decrease the chance of inducing rot and give the plant time to put out new roots. Until the plant seems to be rooted and happy, please keep it in a warm place that receives bright but indirect light. Aloe vera plants in pots Growing How to Care for an Aloe Vera Plant Lighting: Place in bright, indirect sunlight or artificial light. A western or southern window is ideal. Aloe that are kept in low light often grow leggy. Temperature: Aloe vera does best in temperatures between 55° and 80°F (13° and 27°C). The temperatures of most homes and apartments are ideal. From May to September, you can bring your plant outdoors without any problems, but do bring it back inside in the evening if nights are cold. Fertilizing: Fertilize sparingly (no more than once a month) and only in the spring and summer with a balanced houseplant formula mixed at 1/2 strength. Repotting: Repot when root-bound, following the instructions given in “Planting” above. Watering Aloe Vera Watering is the most challenging part of keeping aloe vera healthy, but it’s certainly not rocket science! The aloe is a succulent plant accustomed to arid environments, but its thick leaves still need sufficient water. Water aloe vera plants deeply but infrequently. In other words, the soil should feel moist after watering but should be allowed to dry out to some extent before you water again. If the soil stays overly wet, the plant’s roots can rot. To ensure that you’re not overwatering your plant, allow the top third of potting soil to dry out between waterings. For example, if your plant is kept in 6 inches of potting soil, allow the top 2 inches to dry out before watering again. (Use your finger to test the dryness of the soil.) Generally speaking, plan to water your aloe plant about every 2–3 weeks in the spring and summer and even more sparingly during the fall and winter. One rule to remember for fall and winter watering is to roughly double the time between waterings (compared to your summer watering schedule). In other words, if you water every 2 weeks in summer, water every 4 weeks in winter. When watering, some excess water may run out of the bottom of the pot. Let the pot sit in this water so the soil absorbs as much as possible. Wait 10–15 minutes, then dump any remaining water. Aloe vera plants and pups Photo by cgdeaw/Shutterstock Removing and Replanting Aloe Vera Offsets (Pups) Mature aloe vera plants often produce offsets— plantlets, pups, or babies—that can be removed to produce an entirely new plant (a clone of the mother plant, technically). Find where the offsets are attached to the mother plant and separate them using pruning shears, scissors, or a sharp knife. Leave at least an inch of stem on the offset. Allow the offsets to sit out of the soil for several days; this lets the offset form a callus over the cut, which helps to protect it from rot. Keep the offsets in a warm location with indirect light during this time. Once the offsets have formed calluses, pot them in a standard succulent potting mix. The soil should be well-draining. Put the newly potted pups in a sunny location. Wait at least a week to water and keep the soil on the dry side. How to Get Your Aloe Vera to Flower Mature aloe vera plants occasionally produce a tall flower spike—called an inflorescence—from which dozens of tubular yellow or red blossoms appear. This certainly adds another level of interest to the already lovely aloe! Unfortunately, a bloom is rarely achievable with aloes that are kept as houseplants since the plant requires nearly ideal conditions to produce flowers: lots of light, sufficient water, and the right temperature range. Due to these requirements (mainly lighting), aloe flowers are usually only seen on plants grown outdoors year-round in warm climates. To give your aloe the best shot at flowering: Provide it with as much light as possible, especially during spring and summer. Aloes can be kept outdoors in full sun during the summer when temperatures are above 70°F (21°C). Bring the aloe inside if nighttime temps threaten to drop below 60°F (16°C). Note: Don’t move your aloe from indoors to full sun right away; it needs time to adjust to the intense light, or it may cause sunburn. Allow it to sit in partial shade for about a week before moving it to a brighter location. Ensure the plant is getting the right amount of water—enough to keep it from drying out completely but not enough to drown it! If the plant’s being kept outdoors, make sure that it’s not getting consistently soaked by summer rains. Give your aloe a proper dormancy period in the fall and winter. Aloe tends to bloom in late winter or early spring, so giving them a period of rest consisting of less frequent watering and cooler temperatures may encourage them to flower. Don’t be surprised if it still doesn’t flower. Despite our best efforts, indoor conditions just aren’t ideal for most aloes, so don’t be surprised if yours simply refuses to bloom! Types Especially attractive Aloe include: Aloe variegata Tiger or Partridge-Breasted Aloe – A compact aloe characterized by short, smooth leaves with uneven white stripes. A. aristata Lace Aloe – A small plant with white-spotted, finely sawtoothed leaves. A. glauca Blue Aloe – A larger aloe species with silver-blue leaves. Harvesting Aloe Vera Gel To make use of the aloe vera plant’s soothing properties, remove a mature leaf from the plant and cut it lengthwise. Squeeze the gel out of the leaf and apply it to your burn, or lay the opened leaf, gel side down, on the affected area. Learn more about aloe vera’s healing properties. Do not ingest the gel, as it can cause nausea and other unpleasant symptoms.

Aloe Vera, also known by its botanical name “Aloe barbadensis”, is a succulent family member with over 300 species found worldwide. This desert-native plant enjoys hot and tropical climates. It’s reasonably drought-resistant and can be found worldwide from the Californian coastline to the tip of Africa. The aloe vera plant has a long rich history and is known as one of the oldest plants on record due to its vast medicinal properties and health benefits. The Egyptians were the first to record the nourishing benefits some 6,000 years ago; even Cleopatra is said to have incorporated aloe into her daily skin regime! The Aloe plant is known for its thick, succulent leaves plumped with a watery gel-like substance. The leaves grow from the plant’s base in a rosette shape with flexible spines with jagged edges. Once matured, this plant can grow spiky flowers in shades of yellow, orange and red; however, many young plants can take years to produce a flower or, in some cases, never do. Looking to introduce an Aloe Vera plant to your growing plant family? Read on to learn more about how you can care for your Aloe at home. Where to buy aloe vera ireland How to care for your Aloe Vera Aloe has won over the hearts of many plant lovers for its hardiness and tolerance of infrequent watering. Here are some key care tips to keep your Aloe happy and healthy: Sun illustration Light- Aloe vera require lots of bright indirect sunlight. We recommend typically 6-8 hours per day. Your Aloe will be happiest on a sunny window ledge. Water illustrationWater- Aloe can handle drought conditions but prefers to be watered regularly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. If the plant is left dry too long, the leaves will wilt and pucker slightly. They also cannot tolerate standing in water so, ensure there are plenty of drainage holes in your plant to allow excess water to run out. To ensure drainage in a pot, you can use cactus potting soil or mix in some perlite or coarse sand and make your own mix. Thermostat illustrationTemperature-. Aloe vera gel is 96% water — which is why it can stand up to desert conditions. Your little Aloe enjoys an average temperature between 13°C.-18°C. From May to September, you can bring your Aloe outdoors but do bring it back inside in the evening or when temperatures begin to drop. In the winter months, keep away from areas with fluctuating temperatures and drafts. Feed- Aloe vera does not require high soil fertility. Feeding once a year, in the spring, with a houseplant fertiliser should be sufficient. Cleaning- Aloe vera plants are reasonably resistant to disease however indoor growers might find some issues with mealybugs and scale. Avoid overwatering your Aloe and keep the stems dust-free to prevent these issues from occurring. aloe vera uses Typical Uses of Aloe Vera Rated as one of the best air-purifying plants by Nasa's Clean Air Study, Aloe Vera works to remove harmful toxins and pollutants in the air and boost the room’s humidity. This can decrease the level of airborne diseases that can contribute to cold or flu-like symptoms. And, as if that wasn’t enough, this hardworking plant has been used as a medicinal plant for thousands because of the many healing powers contained within its leaves. Aloe Vera is proven to contain vitamins and enzymes that detoxify and support the immune system, lower cholesterol and blood sugar, digestion, provide a boost of vitamins, and help with acne and dehydrated skin. The gel within the plant is loaded with healing vitamins, antioxidants, and nutrients and can improve and soothe dry skin, burns and acne. It’s worth noting that while aloe vera is gentle, some people have been known to develop skin irritations and allergic reactions from it. The gel should never be used on cuts or burns that are quite serious. Always test a small amount on a tiny patch of skin before applying to the affected area and stop use if irritation occurs. aloe vera benefits Where to Keep Your Aloe Vera at Home This versatile plant is known to shine in any space within the home or workspace however, we believe it works best on a kitchen windowsill, where it acts as a self-regenerating first-aid kit. Because of its air-purifying properties, Aloes are also an excellent addition to bedrooms. It emits oxygen at night instead of during the day, giving the air around it a boost that could benefit your sleep! Stuck on ideas on how to pot your Aloe Vera?

         "An aloe-killer’s guide to thriving aloe vera plants Veronica May 8, 2025 Aloe vera has a mixed reputation: some aloe parents can do no wrong, while others feel they can’t do anything right (and have many dead aloes to prove it). What’s weird is that the aloe-killers among us might have the ‘greenest’ thumbs. I used to be in the green-thumbed aloe-killer camp, but after lots of research, trial and error I’ve unearthed several simple tricks to keep aloes happy. Whichever group you belong to, your aloes will thank you – and reward you – for reading this Aloe-Killer’s Guide to Thriving Aloe Vera Plants! Are you ready to help your aloes grow like mad and produce a bunch of aloe babies? Let’s dig in! Aloe Origins The first step to understanding your green friend is to learn its origins – its native habitat. You may have plucked your baby from the shelf of a home goods store, but that’s not what we’re talking about. Aloes originated in South Africa. Picture sunny, hot dry days and sandy, red soils cracked and thirsting for the infrequent blessing of rain. This environment is harsh for many people and plants, but this is exactly the context where aloes adapted to flourish. So, here is the first insight – aloes like it tough. They thrive on droughts, soak up simmering heat and don’t care for rich, fertile soils. This is where good-intentioned, hyper-involved plant parents get off to a bad start with aloes. Aloes just don’t want the kind of attentive care and common enjoyments that most other plants eat up. However, it’s important not to go extreme with the neglect either! Water Control is Key The leading cause of aloe demise is too much water. What throws aloe parents for a loop is that watering frequency is just a small part of the equation! Most of the advice that follows pertains to keeping water levels in your aloe’s potting mix exactly right. How Frequently Should I Water My Aloe? You’re going to love this answer: it depends! Not helpful, I know. I will unpack that. But! This is an important point here. It’s really key to water your aloe based on when it needs it and not based on a schedule. The better question to ask is: How do I know when my aloe wants water? 3 Signs Your Aloe Wants a Drink 1. The pinch test: Give a few of your aloe leaves a light squeeze. How firm does the leaf feel? Is there a little give when you pinch? Aloe leaves are basically water reservoirs, like the humps on a camel’s back. When the leaves lose some firmness, this indicates that the plant is using its water reserves and will want a drink sometime soon. Don’t wait until the aloe uses so much of its reserves that the leaves start to flop over or bend in the middle. To stick with the metaphor: water before you have floppy camel humps! At first the pinch test may be a difficult way to gauge the right moment to water, but it is the most accurate measure and you will get a feel for it after a few water cycles! 2. The finger test: Poke a finger into the soil a few inches down. Dry as a bone? Water immediately if the leaves look floppy. If the leaves are fine, wait a few days to give your aloe a period of complete drought, then water. 3. The looky-loo: When in doubt, pull it out! Wait, that sounds wrong… Um, if you are more of an eyes-on kind of person you can pull your aloe out of its pot to see if the soil is completely dry. This is also a great opportunity to see how the root system is doing (more on roots later). The Gist of Watering Air humidity, ambient temperature, pot, soil mix, root system and sunlight – all of these factors combine to impact how often an aloe is watered. As a general guide, aloes like water every one to three weeks in summer and less frequently in winter when aloes go dormant and do not put energy into new growth. Potting Mix: The Keeper of Water The potting medium your aloe lives in determines how much moisture is retained after a watering. Regular potting mix or garden soil holds onto water like a sponge. If you think back to its native habitat, that’s not what aloe wants! Aloes like a sandy potting mix with great drainage. Store-bought cactus or succulent mixes work quite well, but there may be room for improvement. If you notice the potting medium holding onto a lot of water for days, amend the soil with materials like coarse builder’s sand*, chicken grit, perlite or pumice to improve drainage and provide a lighter, airier space for aloe roots. Experiment with different potting mixes to find the combination that works best! * Avoid fine grain sand, like play sand 5 Keys to Picking the Perfect Pot Now here is a factor you may have overlooked: the material, size and shape of your pot plays a huge role in regulating water! 1. Plastic vs. Terracotta: If you live in a cool and humid climate you likely struggle with soil holding too much water. In this case, terracotta will make an excellent pot because its porous nature will wick away extra moisture sitting in the soil. If you live in a hot and dry environment where soil dries out fast, non-porous pots like plastic work best. This wide, shallow pot is perfect for aloes! 2. Go wide, not deep: Aloes have shallow root systems that like to stretch out and don’t do much downward exploration. Pick a pot that is wider than it is deep to match that growth habit. Deep pots are a one-way ticket to root rot town. If there are no roots at the bottom of the pot, the moisture in that soil will not be consumed by the aloe and bing-bam-boom you’ve got root rot! 3. Keep it cozy: Aloes like to be a bit pot-bound. The roots of your aloe should take up about half the pot, by volume to keep a cozy environment for the roots. This also helps prevent overwatering, because there is just a small amount of soil to hold on to moisture. 4. Let it drain: Drainage holes are key because pooling water will be the death of your aloe. I know, often the prettiest pots don’t have holes. But for the sake of your aloe, either drill a hole in the pot with a diamond-tipped drill bit or save it for another plant that likes wet soil. 5. Leave room for pups: With this guide in hand, there is no doubt you are going to have a happy aloe – and happy aloes like to have pups (little aloe babies)! Leave some space for aloe babies to emerge by choosing a pot that is a little wider than the current plant needs. Aloes Like it Hot – but Not Too Hot! Aloes are happiest in 55 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 27 degrees Celsius) and live natively in USDA hardiness zones 9 through 11. If you live in cooler climates, aloes will be happy indoors all year round. When the weather warms up you may be tempted to bring your aloe outside for a summer vacation. If you do bring your aloe outside, be sure to make it a gradual transition over the span of a week (starting your aloe off in a shadier and cooler location to mimic its indoor environment) and monitor how your aloe responds. A quick change in sunlight and temperature exposure from bringing your aloe outdoors can shock and kill your aloe: summer vacation can quickly turn into death in paradise. Your aloe’s final destination outdoors should provide bright indirect sun throughout the day, and potentially several hours of direct sun in the morning (depending on your aloe’s unique preferences).

Aloes absolutely love bright sun, but it can become too much of a good thing. Set up indoor aloes around south-facing windows, but don’t let the leaves directly touch the glass to keep them safe. Window glass can intensify sun beams and sizzle aloe leaves. Burnt aloe leaf tip If you notice your aloe leaves turn pale, orange or brown it’s likely that your aloe is getting too much sun — but don’t fret! There is a simple solution: relocate your aloe to a shadier spot. Jasmine Rosie from the gardenstead succulent group did exactly this when she noticed her aloes turning orange. Her aloe not only bounced back, but is doing better than ever! Jasmin Rosie's aloe. Photos courtesy of Jasmine Rosie. These pale-orange leaves indicate sun stress. Photo courtesy of Rita Kurgan. If you don’t have an abundance of light, that’s okay — I don’t either and I grow aloes anyway! You’ll notice that aloes with less-than-optimal light will grow leggier and floppier leaves, but the plant will continue to live and grow. If you want the best for your aloe, consider popping a grow light over it to make up for the lack of natural rays. Aloe’s Got 99 Problems but Fertilizer Ain’t One Perhaps after reading all this you’re starting to feel like aloes are a bit finicky. Thankfully, when it comes to fertilizing, aloes are low-key. Aloes don’t need any fertilizer, but if you want to give your aloe a jolt of energy to kick off the growing season, you can supply it with a phosphorus-heavy, water-based fertilizer at half strength once a year in spring (try saying that ten times fast!). A houseplant fertilizer with a ratio around 10-40-10 (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium) should do the trick. Say Aloe to My Little Friend! Forming a friendly relationship with your plants is all about understanding who they are and what they need. That’s why, at gardenstead, we believe that anyone armed with the right tips and an experimental mindset can keep their plants happy and thriving – and aloe is not an exception to that!
